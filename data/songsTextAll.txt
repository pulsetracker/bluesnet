	 when the rain pour down outside 
 and the more i thought 
	 the more i began to cry

my days seem lonesome 
	 and my nights they are so long

 i wish i had somebody 
	 to drive my blues away

blues and trouble 
	 both running hand in hand 
 if you ain't never had the blues 
	 you just can't understand

you can always tell 
	 when your woman's got another man 
 she will take your bad treatments 
	 and do the best she can

 i believe that woman 
	 done let my best friend take my place

every evening 
	 do you stop by my door 
 but since he's got my woman 
	 she don't stop there no more

she's just a no-good woman 
	 and i took her to be my friend 
 but she's taught me a lesson 
	 about no-good women and men

walking walking 
	 talking to myself 
 wondering if i die 
	 would my baby love somebody else

sighing and crying 
	 broke down with the blues 
 my clothes are worn out 
	 holes all in my shoes

walking across the country 
	 trying to get a stake 
 because my baby 
	 want every cent i make

tired and hungry 
	 i've been walking many days 
 wondering 
	 if my baby would stop her hateful ways

walking across the country 
	 with my head bowed down 
 a woman can still make a man 
	 act like a clown



mr police captain 
	 listen to my plea 
 i want to make my baby 
	 come back home to me

	 and a great big hound 
 i'm going to find my baby 
	 if i have to track her down

 all i want is a search warrant 
	 and a bottle of gin

i'm going to get running drunk 
	 and go into that place 
 and that backbiting man 
	 better not show his face

i love my baby 
	 but she treat me so unkind 
 if she thinks she can quit me 
	 she really have lost her mind



i got a notoriety woman 
	 she about to drive me wild 
 beside that woman 
	 sits ever meek and mild

	 got ways like a bear 
 carries a gun in her pocket 
	 a dagger in her hair

to keep her quiet 
	 i knocked her teeth out her mouth 
 that notoriety woman 
	 is known all over the south

i can't get along with her

 staying alone 
	 and doing the best i can

i shipped my trunk 
	 down to tennessee 
 hard to tell 
	 about a man like me

i met a gal 
	 i couldn't get her off my mind 
 she passed me up 
	 says she didn't like my kind

i'm scared to bother 
	 around her house at night 
 got a police dog 
	 craving for a fight

his name is rambler 
	 and when he gets a chance 
 he leaves his mark 
	 on everybody's pants

guess i'll travel 
	 i guess i'll let her be 
 before she sics 
	 her police dog on me



packing my duffle 
	 going to leave this town 
 and i'm going to hustle 
	 to catch that train southbound

i got the georgia blues 
	 for the plow and the hoe 
 walked out of my shoes 
	 over this ice and snow

tune up the fiddle 
	 dust the cat and bow 
 put on the griddle 
	 and open the cabin door

i thought i was going 
	 to the northland to stay 
 south is on my mind 
	 my blues won't go away

potatoes in the ashes 
	 possum on the stove 
 you can have the hash 
	 but please leave me the claw

chicken on the roof 
	 and melons on the vine 
 i'll be glad 
	 to get back to that georgia gal of mine



numbers numbers 
	 about to drive me wild 
 thinking about the money 
	 that i should have had

i dreamed last night 
	 the woman i love was dead 
 if i had played the dead row 
	 i would come out ahead

i act like a fool 
	 and played on three six nine 
 lost my money 
	 and that gal of mine

	 and see miss stella gold

the gals from the alley 
	 slipping all around 
 telling everybody 
	 they're leaving town

i got a yellow gal 
	 and a brown named mame 
 but the best i've ever had 
	 was the old crow jane

	 and with his hair all curls

 i'm sitting here wondering 
	 if a woman's worth it now

	 rope stretching all day long 
 in just a few more days 
	 i won't be able to sing my song



don't trust no woman 
	 who mistreats her man 
 when you think she's in your kitchen cooking 
	 she's got a stranger by the hand

ain't no need of you chasing women 
	 brother if you really haven't got the cash 
 other men get all the chicken 
	 and all you get is hash

i have a lot of woman 
	 but i sure don't want one now 
 she always milks me dry 
	 better than you ever milk a cow

mmm 
	 rope stretching all day long 
 i'm singing now mama 
	 because it won't be long

it wouldn't be so bad 
	 if the rope would just get slack 
 i wouldn't mind at all 
	 but i just got a crick in my back

when it's all over mama 
	 and you're all alone by my side 
 just keep the flies from buzzing by me 
	 and then i will be satisfied

	 hollering and crying 
 i'll take you back baby 
	 if you was dying

come on daddy 
	 and tell me one more time 
 when i left 
	 i didn't have my right mind

	 with my head hung down 
 your black man 
	 ought to get on out of town

 before ten this morning 
	 you had me talking out my head

don't the moon look pretty 
	 shining down from that willow tree 
 i can see my baby 
	 and she can't see me

	 and see what you done done

	 bad luck pass on 
 i'd love to go home any time 
	 and catch another mule in my stall

i don't want no woman 
	 that wears a number nine 
 i wake up in the morning 
	 i can't tell her shoes from mine

	 i wander all by myself 
 thinking about the woman i love 
	 loving someone else

boo hoo 
	 i just can't keep from crying 
 i'm worried about my baby 
	 she's on my mind

sometimes i wonder 
	 do she think of me 
 and again i wonder 
	 if i will ever be free

i'm telling all you women 
	 what's on my mind 
 i never loved one woman 
	 no more at a time

 because i never get the loving 
	 that i really should



my baby ain't good-looking 
	 and she don't dress fine 
 but she gives me money 
	 all of the time

she goes out at night 
	 just like she's on wheels 
 and then i know 
	 she's going out to rob and steal

i lay in my bed 
	 my baby brings me my meals 
 what good is a woman 
	 if she don't rob and steal

i used to live with a woman 
	 they called her tilty til 
 i soon got rid of her 
	 she couldn't rob and steal

i know 
	 how you hungry hustlers feel 
 your woman don't know how to rob 
	 she is too doggone scared to steal

	 on a dollar bill

i haven't any money 
	 for a ticket on the train 
 but i will ride the rods baby

	 what more can i do 
 i gave you my love 
	 and tried to get along with you

i fed you when you were hungry 
	 took you in when you was outdoors 
 i give you my money 
	 and even bought your clothes

i tried to treat you right

 dirtiest old stuff 
	 i ever seen

now i got a gal 
	 she is big as a bull 
 she never stops drinking 
	 till her belly gets full

gets full of liquor 
	 and tries to sing 
 tight like that 
	 and shake that thing

 i tried to stop her 
	 and i got a good cussing

i saw your mama 
	 your papa too 
 what they was doing 
	 just won't do

i slipped up on them 
	 and took one look 
 what they was doing 
	 wasn't in the book

	 and the whole day through 
 i'm so full of blues 
	 i don't know what to do

	 to get these blues off my mind 
 i believe i'll get drunk 
	 and stay drunk all the time

well i'm going to leave you 
	 i ain't going to sing no more 
 because i'm full of blue 
	 and i have got to go



in the wee midnight hours 
	 long before the break of day 
 when the blues creep up on you 
	 and carry your mind away

while i lay in my bed 
	 and cannot go to sleep 
 while my heart's in trouble 
	 and my mind is thinking deep

my mind was running 
	 back to days of long ago 
 and the one i love 
	 i don't see her anymore

blues why do you worry me 
	 why do you stay so long 
 you come to me yesterday 
	 been with me all night long

i've been so worried 
	 i didn't know what to do 
 so i guess that's why 
	 i've had these midnight hour blues

	 and you mistreats me all the time

	 swear but you won't pay that no mind

can you remember mama 
	 in the morning i knocked upon your door 
 you had the nerve to tell me 
	 that you didn't want me no more

ain't it lonesome 
	 sleeping all by yourself 
 when the one that you love 
	 is loving someone else

	 see what tomorrow brings 
 may bring drops of sorrow 
	 and it may bring drops of rain

now i love my baby 
	 but [she, my baby] don't love me 
 when i get in trouble 
	 she is the last one that i see

going down on the bottom 
	 back to the lone star state

	 i don't want you to make me wait

so long people and sweethearts 
	 i'll soon be on my way 
 now i'm leaving this lonesome old town 
	 now i may come back some day

now i never got worried 
	 until the fireman rang his bell 
 two keen long whistles 
	 bid me long farewell



now i love my good corn liquor 
	 and i really mean i do 
 now i don't care who knows it 
	 and i really mean that too

now i've been drinking my good corn liquor 
	 i mean don't no one get rough 
 now i try to treat everybody right 
	 but i mean don't start no stuff

give me another half a pint 
	 [and, then] maybe i'll go home 
 the reason why i'm getting drunk today 
	 i swear my baby's gone

some folks like their alcohol 
	 but give me my corn i believe all the time 
 reason why i love it so well 
	 it's so soothing to my mind

so give me some more corn liquor 
	 if i get drunk [just please, please just] take me home 
 i ain't going to bother nobody 
	 just let the good times baby roll on

	 swear and it won't be long 
 i'm going to catch the first thing smoking 
	 and down the road i'm going

where i long ain't here baby 
	 it's way out in the west 
 in the smoky mountains 
	 where the eagle builds his nest

did you ever love a girl 
	 a girl you hate to lose 
 don't lose your temper 
	 when you've been drinking booze



i had the blues before sunrise 
	 with tears standing in my eyes 
 it's such a miserable feeling 
	 a feeling i do despise

seems like everybody 
	 everybody's down on me 
 i'm going to cast my troubles 
	 down in the deep blue sea

today have been 
	 such a long old lonesome day 
 i've been sitting here thinking 
	 with my mind a million miles away

blues starts a-rolling 
	 and it stops at my front door 
 i'm going to change my way of living 
	 ain't going to worry no more

now i love my baby 
	 but my baby won't behave 
 i'm going to buy me a hard-shooting pistol 
	 and put her in her grave

	 around the corner by myself 
 and if i can't find my baby 
	 i don't want nobody else

	 and she didn't even say goodbye 
 how come she left me 
	 lord i really don't know why

	 because she treated me so unkind 
 treated me so unkind 
	 till i swear i lost my mind

	 there's a good man has gone down

oh it looks mighty cloudy 
	 and i believe it's going to rain

	 because i ain't got a lousy dime

so i'm a hard-hearted papa 
	 i've done changed my ways 
 and i think they will stay changed 
	 for the rest of my days



you left me crying baby 
	 please come back to me 
 and you know i've done all baby 
	 i've been as good as i could be

why did you go 
	 and leave me cold in hand 
 i know what it's all about 
	 it was on account of your other man

now i can't sleep at night 
	 there's rocks all in my bed 
 because i ain't got you pretty mama 
	 to hold my aching head

i'm going to buy me a shiny pistol 
	 i'm coming after you 
 i ain't going to let you 
	 treat me just like you do

so watch your step mama 
	 you know what you've done 
 if you don't come back to me 
	 hot spring water won't help you none



minutes seem like hours 
	 and hours seem like years 
 since i've had these blues 
	 i just can't keep from shedding tears

i'm going to tell everybody 
	 what my good gal done to me one day 
 she put me out and broke my heart 
	 just to pass the time away

now i ain't got no money 
	 and i ain't got nowhere to stay 
 but that's all right baby 
	 if you want to turn me away

you know i work hard baby 
	 and i brung you home my check 
 now i ain't never loved no woman 
	 like i loved you yet



you evil-hearted woman 
	 you got a heart like a stone 
 you don't mean me no good 
	 so i leave you alone

you used to be sweet 
	 but you ain't sweet no more 
 you want to leave me alone 
	 and stay away from my door

you're just like a rattler 
	 you always ready to bite 
 so i'm going to get me a good woman 
	 who will treat me right

yes you're evil 
	 just as evil as you can be 
 i don't want you to cook for me no more 
	 because you might poison me

so be on your way evil-hearted woman 
	 and stay away from my door 
 i done took your foolishness long enough 
	 and i don't want you no more



women if you got a good man 
	 give him three good meals every day 
 if you don't 
	 some other woman is going to tow your man away

i've got so many women 
	 that i don't care when one dies 
 i don't even weep 
	 i don't even cry

some men crave high yellow 
	 but give me black or brown 
 because i can't tell the difference 
	 when the sun goes down

blacker the berry 
	 sweeter is the juice 
 i got a good black woman 
	 and i ain't going to turn her loose

they say black is evil 
	 and they don't mean you no good 
 but i would not quit my black woman 
	 baby if i could

i've got a good black gal 
	 i've got a good black gal 
 she's my buddy 
	 and i swear she is my pal



whiskey is my habit 
	 good women is all i crave 
 and i don't believe in two things 
	 will carry me to my grave

i'm going to louisiana 
	 where i can drink and have my fun 
 i can't stay here much longer 
	 because my time has just about come

when you see me leaving baby 
	 don't you wear no black 
 you see your loving daddy 
	 walking down some lonesome railroad track

when i was a hustler 
	 i'm in my prime 
 i would drink good whiskey 
	 and gamble all the time



she ain't good-looking 
	 but the good gal do go clean 
 and i'm crazy about my baby 
	 though she is so mean

my gal got arrested 
	 and they put her in the county jail 
 they fined her eleven twenty-nine 
	 and they even allowed her no bail

now i'm going to see that judge 
	 and talk to him myself 
 tell him that he sent my gal to the county road 
	 and left me by myself

now i never felt so sorry 
	 till the people walked down the lane 
 and my heart struck sorrow 
	 when they called my good gal's name

and i heard the jailor say hello 
	 prisoners all fall in line 
 i'm also talking about that long-chain woman 
	 that got eleven twenty-nine

i've got the blues so bad 
	 that i just can't rest 
 i'm going to ask that jailor 
	 can i do my good gal's time myself



now you got me grieving mama 
	 over nobody else but you 
 yes you got me grieving mama 
	 i really mean that's true

i'm not going to worry 
	 in my life no more 
 if you want to leave me 
	 you can go

now you got me grieving mama 
	 over nobody else but you 
 yes you got me grieving mama 
	 i love no one else but you

i woke up this morning 
	 didn't find you there 
 wondering what man 
	 had his hand running down through your hair down there

but i'm not going to cry 
	 i'm not going to sigh 
 you going to leave me 
	 bye bye bye



she's got a bed in her bedroom 
	 it shines like a morning star 
 when it starts to rocking 
	 it looks just like a cadillac car

baby baby baby 
	 you had better get your back yard cleaned 
 because you better cook the best old corn bread 
	 a poor man ever seen

get your red ripe tomato 
	 and your t-bone steak 
 and if you fix it like i like it 
	 i will get you a new v-eight

i like it early in the morning 
	 i've got to have it late at night 
 i don't want you to fix it 
	 if you don't fix it right

	 baby turn your good bread around 
 because in your kitchen baby 
	 it's where the good stuff can be found

	 so i'm going to rob and steal

	 it's trying to get her back home

i'm going to pay the boss 
	 and get my check-card today 
 and give it to my sugar 
	 if she'll come back home to stay

fussing and fighting 
	 ain't no way to get along 
 this done caused me a world of trouble 
	 and broke up my happy home

i can't work in the daytime 
	 i can't sleep a wink at night 
 thinking the woman that i love 
	 ain't been treated right



i'm going to get me a brand new [shiny] pistol 
	 with a long shiny barrel 
 i'm going to ramble this town over 
	 until i find my girl

i'm going to go to the station 
	 and try to find her there 
 and if the lord has not got her 
	 she's in this world somewhere

she left me with a head full of trouble 
	 and a head full of misery 
 and now she's got me crying 
	 baby please come back home to me

my mother told me 
	 don't you weep don't you moan 
 because son there'll be women here 
	 when you dead and gone

when i get through rambling 
	 and looking this whole world through 
 i won't be dead with trouble 
	 you know i died to lose



now i'm down and out 
	 ain't got no friends around 
 i'm going from door to door 
	 everybody turns me down

now my woman treats me 
	 [just] like i'm a motherless child 
 she's always squabbling 
	 she don't give me a ??? smile

now here i am people 
	 out in the ice and snow 
 my clothes all in pawn 
	 ain't got nowhere to go

she said she liked my music 
	 but my tune's too short 
 but if she gets long winded player 
	 she's sure to get caught

now babe i can't help it 
	 if i can't play long 
 i'm just a little skinny fellow 
	 and a player is strong



if somebody finds me 
	 when i'm dead and gone 
 say i did self-murder 
	 i died with my boots on

took me a smith and wesson 
	 and blew out my brains 
 i didn't take no poison 
	 i couldn't stand the strain

no i ain't no coward 
	 and i'll tell you why 
 i was just tired of living 
	 but wasn't afraid to die

take me to the graveyard 
	 put me in the ground 
 please write on my tombstone 
	 my woman threw me down

in my farewell letter 
	 someone's sure to find 
 goodbye old cruel world 
	 i'm glad i left you behind

	 and my papa can't be found 
 i ain't got nobody

	 going to set this town on fire 
 now when the chance comes up 
	 i'm going to bid this town goodbye

i got ways like the devil 
	 slipping around your gate 
 so i can find me a good gal 
	 or won't have to take no hate

 i sat deep in my saddle 
	 and i don't remember the name

	 and i ??? name 
 just as sure as the train 
	 leaves the rounded curve



i never felt so worried 
	 till i found the loving lady blues 
 

i can't sleep for dreaming 
	 i can't eat for crying 
 i lay down last night 
	 with that gal all on my mind

	 and wears a diamond ring 
 but she can beat anybody 
	 at doing that thing

	 and you ride like a tiger 
 you throws your backbone 
	 clean out of sight



you did cause me to weep 
	 you did cause me to moan 
 you did cause me 
	 to leave my home

i cried last night 
	 and the night before 
 and i swore 
	 not to cry no more

	 and ninety-nine 
 he got killed on that streetcar line

they took him down 
	 that smoky road

	 and turn your lamp around 
 look out your back door

	 i'm down and out

	 and put me out

	 and the territor' 
 going to catch me the first train 
	 i've got to go

 to be uneasy 
	 be treated right

	 and a diamond ring 
 now come her partner 
	 beat me shaking that thing

the day you left me

 i write you a letter 
	 come sneaking back

	 on the road somewhere

	 and count come and count the days i'm gone

	 find me there 
 yes if i drink smoky 
	 find me on the road somewhere

	 but you ought to see mine 
 it ain't so pretty 
	 but it ??? fine

i got up this morning 
	 looked at the rising sun 
 can't nobody run me 
	 like them bloodhounds done

i got up in my stockings 
	 tipping across the floor 
 scared the bloodhounds 
	 are rapping upon my door

now chickens on my back 
	 and there's the hounds on my track 
 i dropped my head 
	 and i couldn't stop to look back

i could hear those pistol balls 
	 zooming by my head 
 i believe to my soul 
	 they going to kill me dead

i got up this morning 
	 just about the break of day 
 i could hear a bunch of bloodhounds 
	 a-coming down my way

i got up this morning 
	 fell down across my bed 
 i could hear something pushing 
	 all around my head



my woman woke up this morning 
	 dollar in her hand 
 two bits for the monkey 
	 six bits for her man



i hocked everything 
	 from my hat down to my shoes 
 so now sweet mama 
	 got those doggone hockshop blues



now right is right 
	 wrong is wrong 
 ain't no harm 
	 to sing a little song

uncle bud went home 
	 just like they said 
 stuck a match 
	 caught a man in his bed

if i go home 
	 about half past ten 
 put the key in the hole 
	 and can't get in

now lucy came home 
	 with a big excuse 
 she left there tight 
	 but she come back loose

i had a little kitty 
	 i called her mine 
 way in the night 
	 i could hear her cry

we shoot a little dice 
	 bound to have a little fun 
 law walked up 
	 and away we run

i asked the lady for a drink 
	 this is what she said 
 i don't have the white 
	 but i have the red

some folks hates it 
	 call it a sin 
 you see women 
	 give money to men



i went down in the alley 
	 trying to sell my coke today 
 and a woman run out and hollered 
	 scared my mule away

i went with iceman jackson 
	 he sold me ice and coke 
 but he blowed in all his money 
	 buying sweet jellyroll

we stopped on eighteenth and federal 
	 just two blocks west of state 
 and when he got up under that ??? 
	 well he would not wait

she said money don't excite me 
	 and that we all know well 
 but jackson showed her fifty dollars 
	 and she almost fell

she had wind like the greyhound 
	 and she sure could run 
 and jackson got down like a reindeer 
	 and he runned her some



tell me pretty daddy 
	 what's the matter now 
 are you trying to quit me 
	 and you don't know how

i'd rather be dead 
	 buried in the sea 
 than to have the man i love 
	 say he don't want me

lord lord 
	 lordy lordy lord 
 oh the man i love 
	 treats me like a dog

i'd rather see 
	 my coffin come rolling in my door 
 than to hear the man i love 
	 say i don't want you no more



i hear these women raving 
	 about their monkey-man 
 about their trifling husbands 
	 and their no-good friends

these poor women sit around 
	 all day and moan 
 wondering why 
	 their wandering papa don't come home

now when you got a man 
	 don't never be on the square 
 because if you do 
	 he'll have a woman everywhere

i never was known 
	 to treat no one man right 
 i keep them working hard 
	 both day and night

i've got a different system 
	 and a way of my own 
 when my man starts kicking 
	 i let him find another home

i get full of good liquor 
	 walk the streets all night 
 go home and put my man out 
	 if he don't act right

you never get nothing 
	 by being an angel child 
 you better change your ways 
	 and get me awhile

i want to tell you something 
	 i wouldn't tell you a lie 
 wild women are the only kind 
	 that do



early this morning 
	 when everything was still 
 my daddy said he was leaving 
	 though it's against my will

he said i'm leaving mama 
	 and your crying won't make me stay 
 the more you cry 
	 the further i'm going away

a man is like a car 
	 that you have to overhaul 
 keep him three or four weeks 
	 and you can't get along at all

i gave him everything 
	 from a diamond on down 
 the next thing i give him 
	 will be six feet of ground



you can always tell 
	 when your best man don't want you around 
 he will come home at night 
	 turn the bed upside down

my heart's full of sorrow 
	 tears come rolling down 
 because my baby 
	 was kentucky bound

the pale moon shines 
	 down on the mountain still 
 way down in old kentucky 
	 mid those high blue hills

shine on old moon 
	 harvest moon shine on 
 because old moon you'll be shining 
	 when i'm dead and gone

i'm going to tell my mama 
	 when i go back home 
 tell her the folks up here 
	 won't let my kentucky man alone



hello central 
	 give me long-distance please 
 i'm begging with tears in my eyes 
	 and down on my bended knees

hello central 
	 give me mr henry brown 
 what you say you were calling 
	 a storm has blown the wires down

listen long-distance 
	 can you send a telegram 
 do this please 
	 before i fall down left in a jam

you just tell him 
	 he better hurry home 
 because i'm tired 
	 of making all these nights alone



takes a southern woman 
	 to sing this southern song 
 lord i'm worried now 
	 but i won't be worried long

when i was downtown 
	 i wouldn't take no one's advice 
 but i ain't going to let 
	 that same bee sting me twice

because i'm going back 
	 where the weather suits my clothes 
 down where there ain't no snow 
	 and the chilly winds never blow

i don't want no northerner 
	 no northern black or brown 
 southern men will stick by you 
	 when the northern men can't be found

you ever been south 
	 you know just what i mean 
 southern men are all the same 
	 from kentucky to new orleans

i'm going back south 
	 where i can get my hambone boiled 
 these northern men 
	 are about to let my poor hambone spoil



the blues came down my alley 
	 and stopped right at my door 
 they made me feel 
	 like i've never felt before

i'm a good-hearted woman 
	 never done nobody wrong 
 but the better i treat my daddy 
	 the worse we get along

if you don't want me daddy 
	 please tell me what to do 
 i've never loved nobody daddy 
	 like i'm loving you

i've got ten little puppies 
	 twelve little shaggy hound 
 it takes all twenty-two 
	 to run my good man down



daddy oh daddy 
	 won't you answer me please 
 all day i stood by your coffin 
	 trying to give my poor heart ease

i rubbed my hands over your head 
	 and whispered in your ear 
 and i wonder if you know 
	 that your mama's near

you told me that you loved me 
	 and i believed what you said 
 and i wished that i could fall 
	 here across your coffin dead

when i left the undertakers 
	 i couldn't help but cry 
 and it hurts me so bad 
	 to tell the man i love goodbye



early this morning 
	 the blues come walking in my room 
 i said blues please tell me 
	 what are you doing here so soon

he looked at me and smiled 
	 but yet they refused to say 
 i asked him again 
	 and they turned and walked away

the first thing they told you 
	 your man you're going to lose 
 at first i didn't believe it 
	 but i found that it was true

blues oh blues 
	 you know you been here before 
 the last time you were here 
	 you made me cry and walk the floor



the time has come 
	 for us to part 
 i ain't going to cry 
	 it won't break my heart

because i'm through with you 
	 and i hope you don't feel hurt 
 

you are like an old horseshoe 
	 that's had its day 
 you're like an old shoe 
	 i must throw away

you're like an old ship 
	 that sprung a leak 
 you ain't young no more 
	 and your loving is weak

you ain't got no money 
	 you're down and broke 
 you're just an old has-been 
	 like a worn out joke



old pal old pal 
	 you stole my man away 
 but that's all right 
	 i'll get him back some day

you stole my man 
	 between midnight and day 
 and if i catch you old pal 
	 i sure will make you pay

why should you 
	 have a daddy of your own 
 old pal old pal 
	 you better let my man alone

old pal you said 
	 two friends could understand 
 but that's no sign 
	 we should take each other's man



going down to the river 
	 take a rope and a rock 
 tie it around my neck 
	 and jump off the dock

ain't no one 
	 can change my mind 
 i've been mistreated 
	 and i don't mind dying

going to get me some poison 
	 kill myself 
 because the man i love 
	 has put me on the shelf

if he didn't want me 
	 he didn't have to lie 
 the day i see him 
	 that's the day he'll die

baby 
	 you don't know my mind 
 when you see me laughing 
	 i'm laughing just to keep from crying

a crooked man's worse 
	 than crooked dice 
 with dice you lose your money 
	 with your man you lose your life

i'm going to get me a razor 
	 and a gun 
 cut him if he stands still 
	 shoot him if he runs

	 swellest man in town 
 women all screaming about me 
	 but i can't give up my brown

daddy's got the washboard 
	 mama's got the tub 
 sister's got the liquor 
	 and brother's got the jug

my water pipe's all rusted 
	 water's running cold 
 someone's in the basement 
	 trying to find the hole



just another evening 
	 wasted away 
 spending and a-lending 
	 and it left me broke today

run here pretty mama 
	 sit down on your daddy's knee 
 i'll tell you 
	 how these women made a perfect fool of me

i wasted lots of money 
	 went out every night 
 my pals done all forsake me 
	 and the times is getting tight

i'm feeling like an outcast 
	 looking like a tramp 
 can't price a post card 
	 can't even buy a stamp

ah you used to call me papa 
	 you used to call me dunce 
 you used to call me daddy 
	 and you used to love me once

some folks need the ice 
	 some folks need the snow 
 if i could get you back 
	 mama i wouldn't need nothing more



you may be little 
	 you may have a tender snoot 
 but i know what you is mama 
	 when you start to root

 still you got your grunt 
	 but you done lost your root

	 in her teens

strutting 
	 down the avenue 
 making eyes 
	 and flirting too

	 big and fat 
 can't blame nobody 
	 for that

	 i can't refuse 
 but i don't want it 
	 if it's ever been used

some is tall 
	 some is cute 
 some is sweet 
	 and some is true

i don't mean 
	 to speak so bold 
 can't use it 
	 if it's forty years old



something pounding 
	 in my breast 
 when i lay down 
	 to take my rest

horrid nightmares 
	 scary dreams 
 then the blues 
	 steps on the scene

oh maybe it's the blues 
	 that keeps me worried all the time 
 if i could lose these weary blues 
	 that's on my mind

happiness that comes around 
	 but never comes to stay 
 if i only had someone 
	 just to drive my tears away

	 she'll turn her back on you

if your woman loves you 
	 she'll stand by you to the end 
 nobody can steal your place

if you get a jealous-hearted woman 
	 be careful what you do 
 because there's always somebody 
	 tell her lies on you

	 good-time places i've always found 
 but it's been so different now

 i wouldn't spend a nickel 
	 not to save your soul

because i'm tired of being mistreated 
	 and the way you do 
 want you to tell everybody 
	 that i'm down on you

you taken my money 
	 you left me cold in hand 
 i'm going to black your eye 
	 you can tell your man

you can go tell the parson 
	 you can tell chief o'brien

	 i'd rather serve some time

you fooled me once 
	 you fooled me twice 
 you fooled me just enough 
	 for me to take your life

you left me this morning 
	 you stayed away all day 
 you must've found something 
	 to keep you away

	 please don't stay the whole night long 
 because you made me love you baby 
	 and i miss you when you go

oh it seems so different 
	 you don't care for me no more 
 but some day baby 
	 you're going to reap just what you sow



oh tell me baby 
	 how can it be 
 you will give everybody 
	 but you won't give me

ooh baby 
	 the sun begins to shine 
 bought you a brand new dress 
	 now you won't pay me no mind

you can spend my money 
	 but you got to stay at home with me 
 got to give me lots of loving 
	 and keep my company



ain't going to cut no kindling 
	 ain't going to buy no corn 
 i wouldn't spend a quarter 
	 not to save your soul

because i'm tired of being mistreated 
	 tired of the way you do 
 want you to tell everybody 
	 that i'm down on you

you fooled me once 
	 you fooled me twice 
 you fooled me just enough 
	 for me to take your life

you taken my money 
	 you left me cold in hand 
 i'm going to black your eyes 
	 you can go tell your man

you can go tell the sergeant 
	 you can tell chief o'brien 
 but before i take it back 
	 i'd rather serve some time

now you left me this morning 
	 you stayed away all day 
 you must have found something 
	 to keep you away



i'm going to build me a castle 
	 out of ice and snow 
 so i can freeze these barefooted women 
	 away from around my door

just because you were a cheater 
	 i won't give up the game 
 it don't break my heart to win 
	 when i lose i feel the same

i'm going i'm going 
	 my face you'll never see 
 but you can kiss my picture 
	 and think the world of me

you accuse me of women 
	 brought your men right before my face 
 after all your mistreating 
	 no one can take your place



don't care what you say 
	 don't care what you do 
 you sure can't quit your woman 
	 and if she put that thing on you

she put that thing on you 
	 she puts it on you right 
 you can't eat when you get hungry partner 
	 you can't sleep at night

i asked a married woman 
	 to let me be her kid 
 she said she's afraid she'd put that thing on me 
	 and i couldn't keep it hid

my woman quit me 
	 got her another man 
 and the way she had that thing on me 
	 i couldn't raise my hand

now from my experience 
	 i give you your advice 
 if you got a good woman partner 
	 you'd better treat her right



mr drayman mr drayman 
	 back your truck up to my door 
 take my trunk down to the station 
	 take it never here no more

i'm in bad luck now 
	 going to catch me somebody's train 
 take this whole world through 
	 my luck will be bound to change

bad luck wakes me every morning 
	 trouble follows me all night long 
 if i see this ain't no place for me 
	 i'm going back where i belong

i just received a letter 
	 baby won't you please come home 
 say the days seem so lonesome 
	 and the nights so long



believe i'll take 
	 my old-timey rider back 
 because she got a way of loving 
	 that her daddy likes

[awful] nice to meet strangers 
	 just to come and spend the day 
 but that old-timey rider 
	 can drive your blues away

did you ever wake up in the morning 
	 and find your rider gone 
 i know just how it feels 
	 that's why i composed this song

i went to the doctor 
	 for my misery 
 said it's nothing but the blues 
	 bearing down on me

and i asked the doctor 
	 [was there] anything that he could do 
 says i can't do nothing 
	 till that woman come back to you



i believe i'll try 
	 them bad-luck dice again 
 if i keep on a-trying 
	 i'll be bound to win

every man tries to gamble 
	 must have a losing day 
 so he shouldn't get evil 
	 and throw my dice away

sometimes i believe 
	 my woman's bad luck to me 
 because every time i start to gamble 
	 i can't throw a thing but a three

i lost all i had 
	 everything i had to lose 
 even lost the one i love 
	 but i swear i can't lose with you

nine and five my weakness 
	 ten and four keeps me all in pawn 
 but if i ever get lucky 
	 i swear i'll have my diamonds on



i am sorry 
	 that i can't take you 
 you don't know how to gamble 
	 nothing else for you to do

it's not because i love you 
	 but it's just because i've been with you so long 
 and i know you bound to miss me 
	 baby when i'm gone

blues have mercy 
	 have mercy on poor me 
 oh it might be my fault 
	 please have my sympathy

baby if you never 
	 never never no more 
 if you never no more see me 
	 you'll miss me when i go

mmm baby 
	 believe i will go back home 
 going back to the one i love 
	 and acknowledge that i done wrong



a hard-headed woman 
	 just like a bulldog without a chain 
 she won't never listen to what you say 
	 and that will leave your heart in pain

i've fooled with women 
	 till i lost everything i own 
 it was a married woman 
	 cause me to lose my home

a woman's so deceitful 
	 but she's so loving and kind 
 you can pack up your trunk to move 
	 but you will change your mind

you told me you loved me 
	 told my boy friend too 
 and i would not have been here 
	 if it don't been for you

when a dumb man tries to gamble 
	 he expects to lose 
 when you got a hard-headed woman 
	 you bound to have the blues



bad luck and trouble 
	 and the blues without a dime 
 when a man's got money 
	 the blues don't cross his mind

always try 
	 to keep a dollar in your hand 
 when you ain't got no money 
	 your woman get another man

don't never allow your woman 
	 to talk no baby-talk to you 
 you can tell by that 
	 they got something in their heads to do

i don't want no woman 
	 if she ain't got a railroad man 
 because every day's like sunday 
	 i mean she's always got a dollar in her hand



keep your back door locked 
	 baby keeps your windows pinned 
 if your husband should knock 
	 tell him you're cooking and he can't come in

you ought to buy you a bulldog 
	 to watch us whilst we sleep 
 so he can see your husband 
	 if he makes a 'fore-day creep

wake up baby 
	 please don't be so still 
 unless you fixing a good way 
	 to get your daddy killed

what's that baby 
	 pecking on your windowpane 
 say the stars is shining 
	 i know it can't be rain

the big star's falling 
	 i know it can't be long before day 
 and i think it's time for me 
	 to make my get-away



you can jive me baby 
	 but i don't believe a thing you say 
 you just a confidencing woman 
	 and wants to have your way

you can spend my money baby 
	 you can get my loving too 
 i'll do most anything 
	 just to get along with you

i lay down on my pillow 
	 i rolled from side to side 
 i didn't have no blues 
	 i just was not satisfied

when you see me coming 
	 my head all hanging down 
 it's that my sweet woman done quit me 
	 the news all over town

my suitcase is packed 
	 my trunk's already gone 
 you can tell by that 
	 i won't be here long



since we been apart 
	 ??? seems strange to me 
 we been together all these years 
	 and now we can't agree

somebody must have told you 
	 something to worry your mind 
 but you should stop your way of living 
	 and stay at home sometime

all my past life 
	 i found till today 
 i've been trying to listen 
	 to everything you say

if you call that leaving 
	 make the best out of life you can 
 but you must always remember 
	 your daddy has been your friend

some of these mornings 
	 you going to long for me 
 you going to want me baby 
	 just for company



when i was society 
	 the women would not let me be 
 now i'm wild and reckless 
	 and nobody cares for me

some people like religion 
	 some like to rob and steal 
 but i like to play with my yellow women 
	 and my whiskey right from the still

cigarettes is my pleasure 
	 and whiskey i do crave 
 and some long tall and slender 
	 to follow me to my grave

i want to tell you something 
	 happened to me one day

	 stole my heart away



i got a little woman 
	 but i swear she treats me mean 
 well she can bake good jellyroll 
	 and she's so nice and clean

she don't make no charges 
	 she don't set no price 
 but if you roll it once 
	 you want to roll it twice

	 says he never heard tell of such 
 little bitty woman 
	 could roll that jellyroll so much

she roll it for uncle bill 
	 he like to lost his mind 
 he want her to keep rolling it 
	 all the time

says i woke up this morning 
	 feeling so bad 
 thinking about the good times 
	 that i once have had

i'm going to pack my suitcase 
	 and down the road i'll go 
 because the good times i used to have 
	 i can't have no more

	 and a great long way from home 
 i ain't got nobody 
	 just to teach me right from wrong

i'm bound down in trouble 
	 and you know just how i feel 
 like a broke down engine 
	 without a driving wheel

	 i've got one stick 
 give me a match 
	 and let me take a whiff quick

i started blowing my gauge 
	 and i was having my fun 
 i spied the police 
	 and i started to run

but the very moment 
	 i looked around 
 my mind fell ill 
	 throwed that gauge on the ground

i used to didn't blow gauge 
	 drink nothing of the kind 
 but my man quit me 
	 and that changed my mind

i know to blow this jive 
	 it's a sin and a shame 
 but it's the only thing 
	 ease my heart about my man



you had plenty of money 
	 in nineteen twenty-two 
 but you let other women 
	 make a fool of you

why don't you do right 
	 like some other men do 
 get out of here 
	 and get me some money too

you sitting down wondering 
	 what it's all about 
 if you ain't got no money 
	 they going to put you out

if you had prepared 
	 twenty years ago 
 you wouldn't have been drifting 
	 from door to door

i fell for your jiving 
	 i took you in 
 now all you got to offer me 
	 is a drink of gin



i tried hard 
	 a long time 
 to get you 
	 to change your mind

you want to know 
	 what it's all about 
 if you love me 
	 you will soon find out

i work 
	 hard for you 
 now tell me daddy 
	 what you going to do

when i see you 
	 walking down the street 
 i get the thrill 
	 from my head to my feet

it's no use 
	 for us to fuss and fight 
 we should love some 
	 every night



you got me 
	 feeling sad 
 the worst feeling 
	 i ever had



i got a man 
	 a real handsome one 
 he ain't no loafer 
	 he's just a little old country boy

i love him 
	 if he is a little old country boy 
 yes i love him 
	 because he fills my heart with joy

some people say he is lazy 
	 but i know that is a lie 
 for three years he been doing my work 
	 and i'm perfectly satisfied

i know he will [learn to] love me 
	 when he gets to be a man 
 because i'm always going to feed him 
	 right from my hand

now people all want to know 
	 why do i follow my man 
 there's no need to explain 
	 because they really wouldn't understand



i'm so sorry you heard 
	 i don't know what to do 
 i'm sorry for the time 
	 i made you blue



baby what's the matter 
	 why don't you be yourself 
 if i didn't love you 
	 i'd get somebody else

but you are so dull and rotten 
	 you think everybody like yourself 
 if i didn't love you 
	 i'd get somebody else

because i love you baby 
	 and i want you for myself 
 if i didn't love you 
	 i would get somebody else

the way you been doing 
	 you know it's wrong 
 how do you expect 
	 for us to get along

now maybe some day baby 
	 you'd know for yourself 
 if i didn't love you 
	 i'd get somebody else



you say i'm a fool 
	 and everyone knows 
 they wondering why 
	 i don't let you go

everybody tells me 
	 what he do 
 but still 
	 i don't believe it's true

you say 
	 he don't treat me right 
 but he say he love me 
	 both day and night

i'm telling you 
	 right from the start 
 i don't intend 
	 for us to part

this is all 
	 i have done my best 
 i love him 
	 and darn the rest



i'm so down-hearted 
	 feeling sad 
 baby you left me 
	 sick in bed

mama and papa told me 
	 when i left my home 
 i would have to face 
	 the world alone

i keep knocking 
	 but they won't let me in 
 because you in there with your new love 
	 drinking your gin

i'm so down-hearted 
	 no place to go 
 out in the rain 
	 hail sleet and snow

i'm so down-hearted 
	 everywhere i go 
 hard luck and trouble 
	 meets me at the door



my man done quit me 
	 he done throwed me down 
 i'm sad 
	 because he didn't call around

did you ever lay down 
	 and dream the whole night long 
 dream about your man 
	 and all your ??? is gone



last night i went out alone 
	 i was lonesome as could be 
 how i longed to find someone 
	 to keep my company

strange man strange man 
	 let me come close to you 
 i'm feeling lonely 
	 won't you tell me what to do

i'm looking for someone to love 
	 who can your good gal be 
 i ain't got nobody 
	 and you sure look good to me



call me a freakish man 
	 what more was there to do 
 just because she said i was strange 
	 that did not make it true

i sent her to the mill 
	 to have her coffee ground 
 because my wheel was broke 
	 and my grinder could not be found

you mix ink with water 
	 bound to turn it black 
 you run around with funny people 
	 you get a streak of it up your back

there was a time when i was alone 
	 my freakish ways to see 
 but they're so common now 
	 you get one every day in the week

had a strange feeling this morning 
	 i swear i've had it all day 
 i'll wake up one of these mornings 
	 that feeling will be here to stay



now i was just sitting here wondering 
	 where i would go get some ease 
 now i'm going back to california 
	 so i can do just as i please

crossing that old desert mama 
	 just like breaking the hindenburg line 
 now if you get ditched off on that freight train 
	 you know that will be the end of the line

oh yes i know i know 
	 oh yes i know 
 now the train's at the station 
	 in my mind i'm made up to go

when i reach old los angeles california 
	 you ought to hear me jump and shout 
 now the people in los angeles 
	 they didn't know what it's all about



i feel bluer this morning 
	 than i ever felt before 
 i'm changing friends and men 
	 and i won't be blue no more

i know you 'buke and dog me 
	 baby with your forty-five 
 and i couldn't do nothing 
	 but wring my hands and cry

know you trying to be mean babe 
	 and use me as a child 
 but it's going to hurt you to your heart 
	 when i leave you for a while



i'm tired of being scolded 
	 when i know i'm doing to best i can 
 to keep from being your dog daddy 
	 i will get me a brand new man

no use of getting on your knees 
	 because i can't use you no more 
 i been your dog long enough 
	 so this morning i'll have to go

you know all this time 
	 thinking you was all mine 
 and i come to find 
	 you was worse all the time

and i didn't say one sentence 
	 till six months after you left 
 i'll give you one more chance 
	 to make a man out of yourself



did you ever wake up with the blues 
	 and didn't have no place to go 
 and you couldn't do nothing 
	 but just walk from door to door

it was late last night mama 
	 and i hear you cry out in bed 
 i went over rolled my baby 
	 and she talked all out of her head

if you don't like my loving 
	 what make you keep on worrying me 
 why don't you get you some other man 
	 oh mama and just let me be

	 mr blues i come to talk with you 
 mr blues ain't doing nothing 
	 and i would like to get a job from you



i know you like my loving 
	 i can tell from the way you wine

	 you just worries me all the time

i told you pretty mama 
	 i have the best jelly in your town

	 you just keep on hanging around

i swim deep pretty mama 
	 just like a catfish loaded down 
 and every time you see me

when me and my baby start to loving 
	 we wants to fight like cats and dogs 
 but before it's over with 
	 we hollering lord oh lordy lord

	 where you stay last night 
 oh your hair all wrinkled 
	 and your clothes ain't fitting you right

	 and i could not keep from crying 
 thinking about my rider 
	 she done put me down

	 in my back door some day 
 i know my woman 
	 going to come my way some day

	 i just rolled from side to side 
 feel like the girl that i love 
	 have just lay down and died

and i called the undertaker 
	 and the hearse came driving slow 
 made me feel so sorry 
	 to see my baby go

lord i heard a mighty rumbling 
	 just about the dawn of day 
 it was only the wagon 
	 coming to carry my baby away

when i woke up this morning 
	 folks i just started to scream 
 why when i came to find out 
	 that it was just a lonesome midnight dream



lord i remember 
	 what my big fat mama said 
 she so big and fat 
	 got to put ashes all in my bed

now i got rocks all in my pillow

 but when i get ready

	 shift my gear 
 but when any easy riding 
	 goes on here



when i go out singing 
	 i goes out all alone

 that's the reason 
	 that i hang my head and cry

my man quit me this morning 
	 about the break of day 
 and he told me 
	 he was going away to stay

he packed his grip up 
	 didn't even say goodbye 
 when i think of how he left me

i'm a poor boy 
	 i'm a long way from home 
 i'm a poor boy 
	 ain't got nowhere to go

ain't got nowhere 
	 to lay my worried head 
 sometime 
	 i'd sooner to be dead

please tell me 
	 what you going to do 
 

i left my brown 
	 standing in the door 
 what you reckon she said 
	 you're not obliged to go

i'm a poor boy 
	 stood on the road and cried 
 i didn't have no blues 
	 just couldn't be satisfied

now give me 
	 long-distance phone 
 i want to hear 
	 from my sweet mama back home

i said to her 
	 ring six four nine 
 i want to hear 
	 from that bobcat gal of mine



going up to town 
	 what you want me to bring you back 
 oh just anything 
	 you think your baby like

honey honey 
	 you sweet as a plum 
 baby you throw your arms around me 
	 let's have some fun

going up to town 
	 with my hat in my hand 
 i'm looking for the woman 
	 ain't got no man

mama mama 
	 just look at sis 
 standing on the corner 
	 trying to do the twist

come here sis 
	 you old stinking sow 
 you trying to be a woman 
	 and you don't know how

ain't but two things 
	 i just like 
 that's salting the dog 
	 and balling the jack

wears them in the summer 
	 and she wears them in the fall 
 some folks 
	 they don't wear them at all

honey honey 
	 i'm going to tell you the truth 
 the day you quit me 
	 that's the day you die



if i mistreat you gal 
	 i sure don't mean no harm 
 i'm a motherless child 
	 and i don't know right from wrong

please tell me pretty mama 
	 honey where you stayed last night 
 you didn't come home 
	 till the sun was shining bright

i have to go so far 
	 to get my hambone boiled 
 these atlanta women

i done done more for you 
	 than your daddy ever done

 if the blues overtake me

 but when she made the money 
	 is when she lived in the piney wood

blues in my kitchen 
	 blues in my dining room 
 and some nice young fair brown 
	 had better come here soon

	 picking and fussing over turnip greens 
 white folks in the parlor playing cards 
	 and they're serving their cake and tea

my baby loves my baby 
	 like a cow loves to chew her cud 
 but that fool just off and left me 
	 she done moved to the piney wood

 the way she bumps over the hill

if i could holler 
	 just like a mountain jack 
 i'd go up on the mountain 
	 and call my baby back

some day you're going to be sorry

 if she don't come back 
	 i am going to starve

ever since 
	 my baby's been gone away 
 i've been raggedy and dirty

i was lying down dreaming 
	 when the blues eased up on me 
 i was feeling so blue 
	 down-hearted as could be

a brownskin gal 
	 makes a bulldog bark with pain 
 and a bow-legged mama 
	 make a snail catch a passenger train

now you can always tell 
	 when your woman treats you mean 
 i say your meals are never ready 
	 and your house ain't never clean

she will come downstairs 
	 a towel was tied around her head 
 you'll ask her for loving 
	 she'll swear she's almost dead



i left my baby 
	 standing in the doorway crying 
 she said daddy you've got a home 
	 just as long as i got mine

my mama told me 
	 papa told me too 
 some day son 
	 candy's going to be the death of you

now it's chocolate candy 
	 till my dying day 
 the same old candy 
	 is going to carry me away

i've got one good woman 
	 trying to make it four 
 when one pretty woman quits me 
	 i'll have three more



i had the blues last night 
	 i've got them again today 
 my man told me 
	 he was going away

trouble trouble 
	 is all i can see 
 look like my man 
	 has turned his back on me

just let me tell you 
	 what your friends will do 
 grin in your face 
	 and then they'll talk about you

me and my girl friend 
	 went out for a little run 
 when she seen my man 
	 she told him what i had done

bring me a pint of whiskey 
	 and a bottle of beer 
 if i get drunk 
	 i sure don't care

take me back baby 
	 try me one more time 
 i do everything 
	 to satisfy your mind

listen people 
	 to what i'm telling you 
 don't let your left hand 
	 know what your right hand do



i woke up this morning 
	 with the blues all around my bed 
 i felt just like 
	 somebody in my family was dead

i began to moan 
	 and i began to cry 
 my sweet man went away 
	 you know the reason why

if you don't like my sweet potato 
	 what made you dig so deep 
 you in my potato field 
	 three or four times a week

whooping i've been whooping 
	 whooping all night long 
 whooping i've been whooping 
	 ever since my man been gone

my dog got the rabbit 
	 the rabbit fell down on his knees 
 he looked up at the dog 
	 he say won't you have mercy on me please

just as sure 
	 as you hear me sing this song 
 you never miss your jelly 
	 till your jellyroller's gone



play that thing 
	 play that thing just right 
 we got to scuffle 
	 that house rent tonight

my house rent's due 
	 my gas going up to ten 
 i wouldn't have no lights 
	 but the lightman couldn't get in



i want all you people 
	 to listen to my song 
 remember me 
	 after the days i'm gone



the storm is rising 
	 the rains begin to fall 
 i'm all alone by myself 
	 no one to love me at all

my blues at midnight 
	 and don't leave me until day 
 i've got no sweet woman 
	 to drive my blues away

blues 
	 falling like showers of rain 
 every once in a while 
	 think i hear my baby call my name



i'm lonesome as i can be 
	 baby please come home to me 
 because you know i love you 
	 and how come we can't agree

you been gone the whole night long 
	 i believe to my soul something going on wrong 
 but there will come a day 
	 and i know you will be glad to say

i tried to please your mind 
	 and you keep me worried all the time 
 you will either run me crazy 
	 or i'll lose my mind

you know you don't treat me right 
	 when you stay out both day and night 
 and i must stop you now 
	 because you got to consider somehow

you know i love you now 
	 and i love you all along 
 although you my sweet woman 
	 and i mean you can't go wrong



i was sitting in my kitchen 
	 looking way out across the sky 
 i thought the world was ending 
	 i started to cry

the wind was howling 
	 the buildings begin to fall 
 i seen that mean old twister coming 
	 just like a cannonball

the world was black as midnight 
	 i never heard such a noise before 
 sound like a million lions 
	 when they turn loose their roar

poor people was screaming 
	 and running every which a-way 
 i fell down on my knees 
	 i started in to pray

the shack where we was living 
	 she reel and rock but never fell 
 how the cyclone spared us 
	 nobody but the lord can tell



it's raining and storming on the sea 
	 we're miles and miles from shore 
 the way the waves is rocking this ship 
	 we won't see home no more

the wind is so strong 
	 turning this old ship round and round 
 something tells me 
	 won't be long before we're sinking down

the captain say get your lifesavers 
	 fasten them around your waist 
 because we're sinking down 
	 and the lifeboat is your safest place

uncle sam's ship was coming 
	 painted in red white and blue 
 we say we live in new york city 
	 red white and blue brought us all the way through



mmm 
	 i feel myself sinking down 
 my body is freezing 
	 i feel something cold creeping around

my windows is rattling 
	 my doorknob turning round and round 
 this haunted house blues is killing me 
	 i feel myself sinking down

i been fastened in this haunted house 
	 six long months today 
 the blue ghost has got the house surrounded 
	 lord and i can't get away

they got shotguns and pistols 
	 standing all around my door 
 they haunt me all night long 
	 so i can't sleep no more

the blue ghost haunts me all night 
	 the nightmare ride me all night long 
 they worry me so in this haunted house 
	 i wish i was dead and gone



i went down to the levee 
	 and [over, out] to the freight house yard 
 they paid a dollar an hour 
	 but the work was too long and hard

have pigtails in my pantry 
	 neckbones on my shelf 
 i ain't got none to give you 
	 i got just enough for myself

i'm going to buy me a shotgun 
	 long as i am tall 
 i'm going to shoot my woman 
	 just to see her fall

over yonder's the river 
	 yonder is your big lake 
 at your house rent party 
	 you made your last mistake

i chew my bacca 
	 and i spit my juice 
 i tried to love you so hard 
	 but i found out there's no use



although we are drifting 
	 so far apart 
 my arms may be empty 
	 have not give up in my heart

although we are drifting 
	 so far apart 
 my arms may be empty 
	 but never down in my heart



look down look down 
	 that long old lonesome road 
 and look up to the good lord 
	 just before you go

that's a long that's a long 
	 a long old tiresome road 
 you'll find troubles and worries 
	 that you never found before

then look back look back 
	 and see what you're leaving all alone 
 to grieve and worry 
	 after the days you gone

then your days begin dreary 
	 down that long old lonesome road 
 and you want the lord have mercy 
	 how much more further i've got to go

that's a long old road 
	 a long road that has no end 
 then the blues will make you think 
	 about all your right-hand friends



something keep a-moaning 
	 i don't know what it is 
 

when my right eye winks 
	 on my knees i begin to crawl 
 it will be hell to tell the captain 
	 if i catch another man kicking in my stall

there's no use a-worrying 
	 baby about the days being long 
 the black snake is got the dough 
	 you can't roll him from home



they tell me blues and trouble 
	 walk hand in hand 
 but you ain't had no trouble 
	 till your woman falls for some no-good man

a married woman will swear 
	 she'll love you all her life 
 and meet her other man around the corner 
	 and tell the same lie twice

you tell me you've had troubles 
	 and worry all your life 
 man but you ain't had no trouble 
	 till you fall for another man's wife

then if you get a woman of your own 
	 and make her happy night and day 
 there will be some no-good man she'll fall for 
	 pretty soon she'll go away

when it begin raining 
	 and you're looking through your windowpane 
 and crazy about another man's wife 
	 it's enough to drive you insane

but a married woman

now she ain't good-looking 
	 she don't dress fine 
 the way that gal can love 
	 change any man's mind

now she bake good jellyroll 
	 she bakes it nice and hot 
 it never fails 
	 to touch the spot

if i was sentenced to be hung 
	 and this ain't no lie 
 if i could just see my baby 
	 i would be willing to die

now my gal is built 
	 long and tall 
 lord when she starts to loving 
	 i can't help from to fall

she likes her music soft 
	 when the lights are low 
 when she starts to kiss me 
	 does me good down in my toes

when i met my gal 
	 she was dumb as dumb could be 
 but i believe to my soul 
	 she put that thing on me



if you got over fifteen grand 
	 better split it ninety-nine different ways 
 because the racketeers 
	 got no certain place to dig your grave

when they demand your money 
	 you got to give it up with a smile 
 and if you refuse 
	 they'll read about you in a short little while

when the gang is out to get you 
	 it don't do no good to run 
 it's true you can dodge the law 
	 but you can't dodge them slugs out the machine gun

you [slave, work] hard for your money 
	 just to give it to some other one 
 and if you refuse 
	 the answer will be from a racketeer's gun

when the gang is out to get you 
	 they'll follow you everywhere 
 you can even move to west hell 
	 doggone if they don't find you there



you've got a hatchet under your pillow baby 
	 you got ice pick in your hand 
 the best thing you better do 
	 is find you another man

you've got a shotgun in the corner 
	 blackjack under your bed 
 but you'll never catch me asleep 
	 i know you wants to whip my head

you put lice all in my gravy 
	 black potash in my tea 
 but i fed it to your man baby 
	 instead of me

that's the very reason why 
	 you been so mean to me 
 trying to steal my life 
	 to have your old used-to-be



people is [raving, hollering] about hard times 
	 tell me what it's all about 
 hard times don't worry me 
	 i was broke when it first started out

friends it could be worser 
	 you don't seem to understand 
 some is crying with a sack of gold under each arm 
	 and a loaf of bread in each hand

if you're a single man 
	 you better drink and have your fun 
 because when that lovebug bites you 
	 then your worries ain't never  done

people raving about hard times 
	 i don't know why they should 
 if some people was like me 
	 they didn't have no money when times was good



it's been snowing forty days and nights 
	 lakes and rivers begin to freeze 
 some places through my old home town 
	 water's up above my knees

storm begin rising 
	 and the sun begin sinking down 
 i says mother and dad pack your trunk 
	 we ain't safe here in this town

when it lightning my mind gets frightened 
	 my nerves begin weaken down 
 and the shack where we was living 
	 begin moving around

women and children were screaming 
	 saying mama where must we go 
 the flood water have broke the levee 
	 and we ain't safe here no more



you see it ain't what you used to be baby 
	 it's what you are today 
 you see your good looks didn't hold your man 
	 a little black gal's loving stole your man away

i've got a woman now that i love 
	 better than i love myself 
 she treats me so cold sometimes 
	 i think she got somebody else



you arms don't feel the same 
	 your lips is icebox cold 
 it's a mean black snake 
	 is making his morning stroll

you know 
	 you once was the sweetest woman i ever found 
 but since you been running out with your girl friend 
	 you just a plain old everyday clown



if love is a crime then i'm guilty 
	 but there's nothing i can do 
 after all the good women in this world 
	 why did i have to fall in love with you



don't the world seem lonely 
	 when you got to battle it all by yourself 
 even the one you love 
	 turn their back on you for someone else

my mother and dad left me 
	 when i was too small to help myself 
 and my sisters and brothers 
	 drove me away to somebody else

i'm motherless and i'm fatherless 
	 i'm almost friendless too 
 seems the world is down on you 
	 know knows what to do

rocks was my pillow 
	 and the cold ground was my bed 
 the blue skies was my blanket 
	 and the moonlight was my spread



good morning blues 
	 where have you been so long 
 i just stopped by to leave you enough of worries 
	 to last you while i'm gone

my brains is cloudy 
	 my soul is upside down 
 when i get that lowdown feeling 
	 i know the blues must be somewhere close around

the blues is like the devil 
	 it comes on you like a spell 
 blues will leave your heart full of trouble 
	 and your poor mind full of hell

some people say that's no blues 
	 but that story's old and stale 
 the blues will drive you to drink and murder 
	 and spend the rest of your life in jail

the blues and the devil 
	 is your closest friend 
 the blues will leave you with murder in your mind 
	 that's when the devil out of hell steps in



i work all day long for you 
	 until the sun go down 
 and you take all my money and drink it up 
	 and come home and wants to fuss and clown

it hurts to love a person 
	 that don't belong to you 
 because when they find out that you really love them 
	 and they don't care what they do

they'll take your heart and they'll use it 
	 like a football on a football ground 
 and when they get through playing with your heart 
	 and they'll start dragging you all around



want all of you people to listen 
	 while my guitar sings 
 if you ain't got that rhythm 
	 it don't mean a thing

some people thinks i'm dead 
	 because i've been gone so long 
 i just stop to see 
	 would you miss me from singing these lonesome songs

i want all you people to listen 
	 while i swing this song 
 if you were born with that rhythm 
	 honest you can't never go wrong



storm is rising 
	 and the rain begin to fall 
 trouble is breaking down my window 
	 blues breaking down my door

my blues started at sunrise 
	 and rides me all through the day 
 it takes the sweet woman i love 
	 to drive these blues away

come into my arms sweet woman 
	 and please explain yourself to me 
 tell me who do you really want 
	 or do you still want your used-to-be

because sometimes you with me 
	 baby then again you gone 
 if you want your used-to-be 
	 then you better let me alone

blues 
	 falling like showers of rain 
 every once in a while 
	 i can hear my baby call my name



i've been drinking all night long 
	 i've started again today 
 i been trying my best 
	 to drink these worried blues away

some people drinks to hide their [worries and] troubles 
	 but that don't mean a thing 
 when you think your troubles are gone 
	 and you find yourself drunk again

friends i drink to keep from worrying 
	 i smile to keep from crying 
 that's why i cover my troubles 
	 so the public don't know what's on my mind

i said i was through with love 
	 both whiskey wine and gin 
 you know when i found myself 
	 i was lap-legged drunk again

love will make a-many man drink and gamble 
	 and stay out all night long 
 love will drive you to many places 
	 sometimes where you don't belong



mmm 
	 something cold is creeping around 
 blue ghost has got me 
	 i feel myself sinking down

black cat and an owl 
	 come to keep me company 
 they understands my troubles 
	 mmm and sympathize with me

i been in this haunted house 
	 for three long years today 
 blue ghost has got my shack surrounded 
	 oh lord and i can't get away

i feel cold arms around me 
	 and ice lips upon my cheek 
 my lover is dead 
	 how plainly plainly i can hear her speak

my windows begin rattling 
	 and my doorknob is turning around and around 
 my lover's ghost has got me 
	 and i know my time won't be long



it's been snowing forty days 
	 and the ground is covered with snow 
 i'm snow-bound in my cabin 
	 and ice up around my door

i woke up this morning 
	 couldn't even get out my door 
 i was snowbound in my cabin 
	 had water seeping up through my floor

snow begin melting 
	 and the rain begin to fall 
 the backwaters done broke the levee 
	 and i can't stay here no more

rowed my boat 
	 just about four miles across the pond 
 backwater done wrecked my cabin 
	 and there's no place that i can call my home



what makes the rooster 
	 crow every morning before day 
 to let the pimps know 
	 that the workingman is on his way

we're up before sunrise 
	 slaving sixteen hours a day 
 we pay our house rent and grocery bills 
	 and the pimps get the rest of our pay

men can't you see 
	 you can't keep a whole woman by yourself 
 if your best friend can't get your woman 
	 he'll frame her for somebody else

something about some women 
	 that i never could understand 
 they're not satisfied with a good husband 
	 they want some other woman's man

	 and i'll tell you why 
 i was tired of living 
	 but wasn't scared to die

 so goodbye old cold world 
	 i'm glad you're left behind



six pallbearers 
	 take his to his last go-round 
 going to place him 
	 'neath six feet of ground

cemetery 
	 sure is one old lonesome place 
 when you're dead 
	 they throw dirt in your face

yes i loved him 
	 but he trifled with my heart 
 had to shoot him 
	 because he was too smart

went gay-cutting 
	 with another sealskin brown 
 rambled 
	 till the butcher cut him down



going north child 
	 where i can be free 
 where there's no hardships 
	 like in tennessee

going where 
	 they don't have jim crow laws 
 don't have to work there 
	 like in arkansas

when i cross 
	 the mason-dixon line 
 goodbye old gallion 
	 mama's going a-flying

going to daddy 
	 got no time to lose 
 so i won't be alone 
	 can hear my northbound blues



don't know what to do with myself 
	 at night 
 don't know anyone 
	 that will treat me right

	 and don't you call my bluff

need the kind of loving 
	 that will make my heart beat 
 the sort that will thrill me 
	 from my head to my feet



i'm a backbiting mama 
	 looking for a cheating man 
 when you start double-crossing

	 to see me unlock my door

you can tell the world 
	 i ain't no fool 
 i learned backbiting 
	 when i went to school



i've got the dallas blues 
	 and the main street heart disease 
 buzzing around my head

 to that texas town 
	 where you never see the ice and snow

i wonder 
	 if my sweet baby will wait for me 
 maybe someone else 
	



if you see a blind man 
	 on the street 
 just remember 
	 that he's got to eat

 she will walk right in 
	 and make your home life tough

if your good man can please you 
	 don't tell a soul 
 just keep him well supplied 
	 with down-home jellyroll

if he's got a little something 
	 not like the rest 
 just keep him busy 
	 he will never leave your nest

he beats you then and loves you 
	 pay that no mind 
 because what you got must suit him 
	 that's the surest sign

	 looking for a loving man 
 i ain't got nobody 
	 who will come and claim my hand

i'll take a long look 
	 right smack down in your mind 
 and i don't see but one woman 
	 rambling up and down the line

don't kid your mama 
	 you ain't fooling nobody but yourself 
 and when i see on your mind 
	 you would not have no friend

i remember the day 
	 when i was living at lula town 
 my man did so many wrong things 
	 that i had to leave the town

i'm by the riverside 
	 my man caught the transfer boat 
 and the last time i seed him 
	 he had done gone way up the road

well i'm worried now 
	 and i won't be worried long 
 



now if you want to learn this dance 
	 don't do it in a pout 
 put both feet together 
	 and do the macon cutout

you need not to worry 
	 neither think 
 just tell the waiter man 
	 to bring on a drink

now you grab your girl 
	 you hold her tight 
 you do it in one position 
	 all night

ease up daddy 
	 you been a good old scout 
 you made a hit with your mama 
	 now you can't lose out

now back in eighteen hundred 
	 and sixty-two 
 folks mess around 
	 but they didn't know what to do

old uncle mose 
	 he was the jellyroll king 
 he get to flat-foot shuffling 
	 call it everything

old rufus pete 
	 he was very slow 
 all the women loved him 
	 and give him their dough

now take it easy mama 
	 and be a good scout 
 if you want to do this dance 
	 macon cutout



now i went downtown 
	 along broadway 
 looked up at a sign 
	 that said no free meals today

	 i took a seat 
 waiter looked at me and said 
	 hey brother pay up before you eat

i was raggedy 
	 thirsty too 
 last all my money 
	 was won from two-by-two

in my pocket 
	 i didn't have a cent 
 sashay down the street 
	 to where i went

in your pockets 
	 you ain't ain't got a dime 
 look all over town 
	 not a friend you can find

as soon as your money 
	 grows treetop tall 
 bill jack and harry 
	 will give you a call

now listen now brother 
	 this ain't no doubt 
 nobody wants you 
	 when you're down and out

now i was singing 
	 them lonesome kind of blues 
 i thought i'd play some numbers 
	 like most colored people do

i put my money down 
	 on old twenty-two 
 i didn't play no believing 
	 i thought that would do

as soon as i saw 
	 that i had won 
 the man brought over eleven 
	 instead of twenty-one

a friend walked up to me 
	 the very next day 
 he said he lost on that number 
	 the very same way



i got spreading mustard 
	 from north to south 
 seeds taste good 
	 right in your mouth

	 looking for another man 
 she ain't got nobody [in town] 
	 [here] to hold her hand

way down yonder 
	 on cripple creek 
 men all grow 
	 over sixteen feet

would go to bed 
	 but it ain't no use 
 they pile up on the bed 
	 like chickens on a roost

rooster chewed tobacco 
	 and the hen did the snuff 
 bet he can't shimmy 
	 but he struts his stuff

see that fellow 
	 with that derby on 
 looks good to me 
	 just as sure as you're born

tell you the truth 
	 and it's a natural fact 
 could've built a road 
	 without being that black

see that fellow 
	 that's standing right there 
 he don't live here 
	 but he lives somewhere

got a batch of hair 
	 right around his mouth 
 he like he swallowed a mule 
	 and left his tail hanging out

	 and don't [grieve, fret] after me 
 don't you scream and cry 
	 because i'm going back to tennessee

can't read and write 
	 can't even spell my name 
 you drove me away 
	 and drove my heart insane



my love don't change 
	 there's going to be some stealing done 
 and if i backbite you 
	 i don't mean no harm

what do you want with a woman 
	 when she won't do nothing she say 
 what do you want with a rooster 
	 when he won't crow 'fore day

if my love don't change 
	 there's going to be some riding done 
 and if i take you woman 
	 i just be made my run

i wants to wait around here baby 
	 until your fried rice  get done 
 because i think i got a nickel 
	 i wants to buy me one

i wonder could i find a woman 
	 to do like my last rider done 
 she kept it all for her daddy 
	 she didn't give nobody none

said my baby got a bed 
	 it shines like a morning star 
 and when i crawls in the middle 
	 it rides me like a cadillac car

my good gal got a mojo 
	 she's trying to keep it hid 
 but georgia bill got something 
	 to find that mojo with

i said she got that mojo 
	 and she won't let me see 
 and every time i start to love her 
	 she's tried to put them jinx on me

well she shakes it like the central 
	 she wobbles like the l and n 
 well she's a hot-shot mama 
	 and i'm scared to tell her where i been

said my baby got something 
	 she won't tell her daddy what it is 
 but when i crawls in my bed 
	 i just can't keep my black stuff still

well i done got reckless 
	 and i broke my mama's rule 
 i been wandering around georgia 
	 with these doggone scary day blues



down on atlanta 
	 on harris street 
 that's where the boys and gals 
	 do meet

out in the alley 
	 in the street 
 every little kid 
	 that you meet

buzz all around 
	 like a bee 
 shake it 
	 like a ship on the sea

came all the way 
	 from paris france 
 come into atlanta 
	 to get a chance

grab your mama 
	 and hold her tight 
 let's mess around 
	 the rest of the night

grip your head 
	 way up high 
 grab your daddy 
	 and make him cry

people come 
	 from miles around 
 get in dark town 
	 to break them down

down in dark town 
	 night and day 
 trying to dance 
	 them blues away

go all the way back 
	 to newport news 
 singing 
	 these doggone atlanta blues



 
 i want you to start in the morning baby 
	 and roll me with the setting of the sun

 
 i want you to keep it all for your daddy 
	 and don't give nobody none

 
 and if you get some of my loving 
	 you won't want your rider no more

 
 you don't have to worry about your loving 
	 i'm a deep-sea diver and i don't go wrong

 
 that's why i'm singing 
	 these barrelhouse woman blues



you may search the ocean 
	 you might go across the deep blue sea 
 but mama you'll never find 
	 another hot-shot like me

i followed my baby 
	 from the station to the train 
 and the blues came down 
	 like doggone showers of rain

i left her at the station 
	 wringing her hands and crying 
 i told her she had a home 
	 just as long as i got mine

i've got two women 
	 and you can't tell them apart 
 i got one in my bosom 
	 the other one in my heart

the one in my bosom 
	 she's in tennessee 
 and the one in my heart 
	 don't even give a darn for me

i used to say a married woman 
	 was the sweetest woman ever was born 
 but i've changed that thing 
	 you better let married women alone

take my advice 
	 let these married women be 
 because their husbands'll grab you 
	 and beat you ragged as a cedar tree

when a woman say she love you 
	 about as good as she do herself 
 i don't pay her no attention 
	 tell that same lie to somebody else

i really don't believe 
	 no woman in the whole round world do right 
 act like an angel in the daytime 
	 ??? at night

i'm going pretty mama 
	 please don't break this rule 
 that's why 
	 i'm searching these deserts for the blues

i'm going pretty mama 
	 searching these deserts now 
 that's why

 understand you can't rule 
	 and either be my boss

take it from the east 
	 hide it in the west 
 when i get it mama 
	 your can won't see no rest

ashes to ashes 
	 and sand to sand 
 every time i strikes you 
	 you know i got a dozen hands

give you a punch 
	 through that barbed wire fence 
 every time i hit you 
	 you know i ain't got no sense

look here women 
	 don't get hard 
 i'll get me a brick 
	 and use it out of my back yard

if i catch you mama 
	 down in the heart of town 
 take a brand new brick 
	 and tear your can on down

you may be deathbed sickness 
	 graveyard bound 
 i'll make your can moan 
	 like a graveyard hound

you got to stop balking 
	 and raising the deuce 
 i'll grab you woman 
	 and turn you every way but loose



says i'm almost crazy 
	 and i'm all here by myself 
 all these women about to run me crazy 
	 lord she's got someone else

lord she's about to run me crazy 
	 these reckless women are worrying me 
 she don't have to treat me so bad 
	 because she lives in tennessee

lord you'll either run me crazy woman 
	 or either make me lose my mind 
 because you keep me worried 
	 and troubled all the time

lord these womens will run you crazy 
	 they'll drive your heart insane 
 they'll spend all your money 
	 turn around and run you insane

well she spent all my money 
	 and then she drove me outdoors 
 and i was almost crazy 
	 because i had nowhere to go

lord if you got a reckless woman 
	 man don't never let her break your rule 
 and when you know anything 
	 you'd be almost crazy with the blues



i live down in bell street alley 
	 just as drunk as i can be 
 seem like them bell street crow janes 
	 have done got rough with me

i drink so much bell street whiskey 
	 they won't sell [mctell, poor boy] no more 
 i've got the cavenglass boys 
	 playing all around my door

this bell street whiskey 
	 make you sleep all in your clothes 
 and when you wake up next morning 
	 feel like you done laid outdoors

you can get booze down on bell street 
	 for two bits and half a throw 
 they'll make you send out your mother and father 
	 to just break down the jailhouse door

walked in my room 
	 the other night 
 man come in 
	 he want to fight

took my gun 
	 my right hand 
 ??? 
	 i don't want to kill no man

when i said that 
	 he rapped me across my head 
 the first shot i fired 
	 then the man fell dead

bell street whiskey 
	 drove me to the county jail 
 got me laying back here on my bunk 
	 nobody in the world to go my bail



good lord good lord 
	 send me an angel down 
 can't spare you no angel 
	 will spare you a teasing brown

that new way of loving 
	 swear to god it must be best 
 because these georgia women 
	 won't let willie mctell rest

there was a crowd down on the corner 
	 and i wondered who could it be 
 weren't a thing 
	 but the women boy trying to get to me

i went down to the shed 
	 put my suitcase in my hand 
 crowd of women run crying 
	 that mctell be my man

ticket agent ticket agent 
	 which a-way has my woman gone 
 say describe your woman 
	 and i'll tell you what road she's on

she's a long tall mama 
	 five and a half from the ground 
 she's a tailor-made mama 
	 and she ain't no hand-me-down

mama if you ride the southern 
	 i'll ride the santa fe 
 when you get in memphis 
	 pretty mama look around for me

you can't never tell 
	 what a double-crossing woman will do 
 they'll tip out with your buddy 
	 and come home play sick on you

i got two women 
	 you can't tell them apart 
 i got one in my bosom 
	 the other one's in my heart

now the one in my bosom 
	 she's in tennessee 
 and the one in my heart 
	 don't even give a darn for me

i used to say a married woman 
	 was the sweetest woman ever was born 
 i changed that thing 
	 you better let married women alone

take my advice 
	 let all married womens be 
 because their husbands will grab you 
	 and beat you ragged with a cedar tree

now love ain't nothing 
	 single women loving married men 
 it will do for a while 
	 but it will jam you after a end

when a woman says she loves you 
	 about as good as she do herself 
 don't pay her no attention 
	 tell the same lie to somebody else

she'll tell you that she love you 
	 and love you all her life 
 she'll have a man on the corner 
	 and tell that same lie twice

my baby she got a mojo 
	 i believe she trying to keep it hid 
 mctell got something 
	 to find that mojo with

i want to tell you pretty mama 
	 exactly who i am

	 buy you shoes and clothes 
 soon as you got bid change 
	 you put me outdoors

i took you mama 
	 your shoes were thin 
 no man wanted you 
	 no one took you in

when i took you mama 
	 feet'll on the ground 
 ain't no man baby 
	 wanted you around

took your breakfast 
	 brought it to your bed 
 took my comb baby 
	 combed your head

make no difference mama 
	 take your lock and key 
 too many women 
	 want a man like me

going away mama 
	 it won't be long 
 i know you'll miss me 
	 the days i'm gone

i took you mama 
	 treated you nice and kind 
 soon as you got on your feet 
	 you wouldn't pay me no mind



i done told you mama 
	 right from the start 
 i ain't going to let no one woman 
	 break my heart

your time to worry 
	 my time to be alone 
 your reckless disposition 
	 done drove your good man away from home

i told you in my days 
	 things i do 
 go out and work hard 
	 and bring my money home to you

	 run around 
 get out in the street 
	 and act like a sand-foot clown

	 trying to treat you right 
 i drinking whiskey woman 
	 and drunk all night

	 holding up your hands 
 i got myself a woman 
	 you better get yourself a man

	 best you can do 
 i would have been a murderer 
	 if i'd a-fooled around with you

now go ahead baby 
	 leave me alone 
 mess around with you 
	 the chain-gang will be my home

	 fall in line 
 while i sing 
	 this song of mine

	 if you thinks it's wrong 
 it's all right 
	 it's a ??? song

this song's all right 
	 it just won't jump 
 it's all right 
	 it just won't

this song brings joy 
	 to our cry 
 we're baptized 
	 with fire

this song's composed 
	 the blues too tight 
 got the blues tune 
	 but the words all right

this song's all right 
	 it just won't quit 
 it's all right 
	 we're singing it

	 treat me mean

i'm leaving you baby 
	 just because you won't be true 
 oh you don't love me 
	 after all i done for you

	 when the snow was on the ground 
 you mistreated me then baby 
	 eli wouldn't throw you down

you made a mistake baby 
	 after you made your vow 
 but your mistake-making 
	 is all over now

 and you going to be sorry 
	 you did me this way

i worked hard baby 
	 i worked hard every day 
 i even turned over in your hand 
	 every cent of my pay

i been done so dirty 
	 treated so lowdown mean 
 you've even accused me of women 
	 that i ain't never seen

people what's the use of loving 
	 when i can't see why i should 
 especially when you got a woman 
	 and she don't mean you no good

i woke up this morning 
	 got on a stroll 
 met my baby 
	 got her told

look a-here baby 
	 you thinking wrong 
 let your papa help you 
	 to sing this song

i grabbed my coat and hat 
	 down the road i'll start 
 before i'd worry 
	 i'd rather part

i wouldn't work 
	 for no human being 
 neither no woman 
	 that i ever seen

eighteen hundred 
	 ninety years 
 all of my women 
	 sit in rocking chairs

but ever since 
	 nineteen and twenty-three 
 all of my women 
	 been working for me

i got a mind 
	 never work no more 
 i've been badly mistreated 
	 i've been drove from door to door



they arrested my baby 
	 accused her of selling moon 
 judge they found whiskey 
	 but it wasn't even in her room

now good morning judge 
	 judge how do you do 
 i just came here 
	 to have a few words with you

please kind judge 
	 listen to my plea 
 and let my baby 
	 go back home with me



now listen all you prize fighters 
	 who don't want to meet defeat 
 take a tip from me 
	 stay off joe louis' beat

now he won all his fights 
	 twenty-three or four 
 and left twenty of his opponents 
	 lying on the floor

they all tried to win 
	 but the test was too hard 
 when he laid the hambone 
	 couple jumped out for it

listen all you prize fighters 
	 don't play him too cheap 
 if he lands with either hand 
	 he'll sure put you to the seat

now he packs dynamite in his left 
	 he carries a punching right 
 he's the one will make you balky 
	 or as high as a kite

he charges on his opponents 
	 from the beginning of the gong 
 he batters them into submission 
	 then they all sing a song

i bet on the brown bomber 
	 for he knows his stuff 
 and lays it on his opponents 
	 until he get enough

now he's a natural born fighter 
	 who likes to fight them all 
 the bigger they come 
	 he says the harder they fall

that terrific left 
	 boys is all he needs 
 but that six-inch right 
	 come with lightning speed

listen all you prize fighters 
	 don't play him too cheap 
 take a tip from me 
	 stay off joe louis' beat



now everybody's crying 
	 let's have a new deal 
 relief station's closing down 
	 i know just how you feel

everybody's crying 
	 let's have a new deal 
 because i've got to make a living 
	 if i have to rob and steal

now i'm getting mighty tired 
	 of sitting around 
 i ain't making a dime 
	 just wearing my shoe soles down

i ain't making a dime 
	 just wearing my shoe soles down 
 now i woke up this morning 
	 doggone my soul

my flour barrel was empty 
	 swear i didn't have no coal 
 we're going to dance 
	 till another sun

now you go to your wicket 
	 put in your complaint 
 eight time out of ten 
	 you know they'll say i can't

they don't want to give you no dough 
	 won't hardly pay your rent 
 now it ain't costing them 
	 one doggone cent

now i ain't made a dime 
	 since they closed down the mill 
 i'm sitting right here 
	 waiting on that brand new deal



does anybody 
	 does anybody feel like me 
 now if they do 
	 i know the feeling is sad as can be

now i'm going home 
	 to take a snooze 
 try to wear away 
	 a thing they call the feeling blues

i'm tired of fooling around 
	 with one who don't love me 
 if i ever find a way to leave him 
	 if we cannot agree



because what you was you used to be 
	 but you ain't no more 
 i'm giving you your dispossess 
	 welcome's off the door

be on your way 
	 you got yourself in wrong 
 you'll get flat feet 
	 from standing too long

let this be a lesson 
	 now that i have left you flat 
 there's someone sitting pretty 
	 in the place where you once sat

you ought to see him do his stuff 
	 my latest loving man 
 because where you left off 
	 is just the place where he began

you said you craved a gal with speed 
	 that's why i wouldn't do 
 but now the gal you left behind 
	 is way ahead of you

but what you was you used to be 
	 but you ain't no more 
 just make your exit smiling please 
	 there's no use getting sore

you ran away 
	 and left me on the shelf 
 keep right on running 
	 go chase yourself



i ain't going to marry 
	 i ain't going to settle down 
 i'm going to stay down here 
	 and swing these men around

just when you think 
	 that your loving man is true 
 then he's your man my man 
	 somebody else's too

oh big fat woman 
	 with the meat shaking on her bones 
 every time she shimmies 
	 a skinny woman leaves her home



i want all you women 
	 to listen to my tale of woe 
 i've got consumption of the heart 
	 i feel myself sinking low

oh my heart is aching 
	 and the blues are all around my loo 
 blues is like the devil 
	 they'll have me hell bound too

blues you made me roll and tumble 
	 you made me weep and sigh 
 made me use cocaine and whiskey
	 but you wouldn't let me die

blues blues blues 
	 why did you bring trouble to me 
 oh death please sting me 
	 and take me out of my misery



i've got the blues 
	 since i made up my mind 
 i want to stop loving you 
	 because you mistreat me all the time

oh this game called love 
	 i played it on the square 
 but you think 
	 a good woman can be found anywhere

you never meant me no good 
	 you've always had your way 
 but things can't go on forever 
	 they are bound to change some day

so now i'm leaving you 
	 some day you'll understand 
 that's why i can't go on 
	 loving a mistreating man

feeling tired 
	 shoulder's getting sore 
 if you see 'male 
	 you're going to take some more

two for a nickel 
	 four for a dime 
 thirty cents a dozen 
	 and you'll sure eat fine

	 by the way you walk 
 you going to carry 
	 half a dozen off

	 from mistreating me

lord lord 
	 now i ain't got a friend 
 now one gal is in jail 
	 and the other one is in the pen



i've been worrying all day mama 
	 and could hardly sleep last night 
 i had the blues for vicksburg mississippi 
	 and couldn't be satisfied

now if ever they find me the ship at 
	 where i long to be 
 i've got a good gal pretty mama 
	 waiting there for me

now there's nothing i can do mama 
	 oh no more i can say 
 all i know i do in vicksburg 
	 lord is paraday



i love you mama 
	 but you don't mean me no good 
 i done everything for you 
	 sweet mama that i could

i brought you clothes 
	 and diamond rings 
 give you all my money 
	 and everything

if you don't want me mama 
	 now let your daddy be 
 for me i may find someone 
	 that cares for me

i ain't no doctor 
	 i can't ease your pain 
 ain't no brakeman 
	 i can't take your train

you know sweet 
	 i'm a good-looking brown 
 what it takes to please 
	 i'm going to carry that around



the first time i met the blues mama 
	 they came walking through the wood 
 they stopped at my house first mama 
	 and done me all the harm they could

now my blues got at me 
	 lord and run me from tree to tree 
 you should have heard me begging 
	 mr blues don't murder me

good morning blues 
	 what are you doing here so soon 
 you bes with me every morning 
	 lordy every night and noon

the blues came down the alley 
	 mama and stopped right at my door 
 they give me more hard luck and trouble 
	 than i ever had before



had a cool loving mama 
	 and they call her jesse p 
 and she's the sweetest woman 
	 has ever walked down mulberry street

now she's a kind loving baby 
	 and give the men a thrill 
 now the reason i love her 
	 she live in vicksburg on the hill

and i love her i love her 
	 and i always will 
 the reason i really love her 
	 i think of vicksburg on the hill



i were laying upstairs mama 
	 trying to take my rest 
 and a notion struck me 
	 lord i believe i'll go out west

now i'm going out west mama 
	 lord and i can't take you 
 because it's nothing out there mama 
	 that a woman like you can do

just as soon 
	 as a train mama makes up in the yard 
 and i'm out westbound 
	 that's if the bulls don't have me barred



now i'm leaving town baby 
	 because you know you treats me wrong 
 you go out at night and get full of bad whiskey 
	 and stay out the whole night long

and i tried everything mama in this world 
	 to get along with you 
 now and you know i love you 
	 that's why you treat me like the way you do

and i'm going i'm going 
	 mama and your crying won't make me stay 
 and the more you cry mama 
	 the farther that you drive me away

now when i leave this time mama 
	 you can pin crepe on my door 
 and i won't be dead 
	 baby but i ain't coming here no more



i got a letter from texas 
	 how do you reckon it read 
 it said hurry home brother 
	 for the one you love is dead

and i went to the station 
	 but the train had gone 
 i got to thinking about my baby 
	 and i started walking on

and i walked up on a stranger 
	 i told him i was in so much misery 
 he said you'll never start to texas 
	 you better take the t and t

and he dropped me off in texas 
	 in a little place they call san antone 
 and you can't really imagine 
	 how you hear those wild ox moan



now boys i once had a good woman 
	 but i really did not treat her right 
 and i would do everything evil 
	 and everything i could for spite

i would go out at night 
	 and get full of bucket gin 
 and she would be absolutely hospital bound 
	 if she ever even asked me where i had been

now i'm sorry that i mistreated her 
	 just as sorry as a man can be 
 now it seem like the more that i do for her 
	 it is the less she care for me

now boys if you got a good woman 
	 treat her kind in every way 
 because a real good woman 
	 can't be found every day



boys have you ever had a woman 
	 and she didn't mean you no good 
 and you trust her with your hide 
	 and she treat it just like a piece of wood

and you will turn your back on everybody 
	 baby you will really worry you best friend 
 on account of a no-good woman 
	 and then she loving other men

then you will sit right down and worry 
	 about a friend that you could gain 
 after you have forsaken everybody 
	 it will be on account of another dame

now boys don't never let 
	 no woman treat you nice and kind 
 because she's only been you 
	 i can tell you about the mine



i met a woman in west texas 
	 she had been left by herself all alone 
 i spied her looking ??? cross me 
	 where i wasn't even known

she fell for me a raggedy stranger 
	 standing in the drizzling rain 
 she said daddy i'll follow you 
	 though you don't know my name

we snuggled closely together 
	 muddy water around our feet 
 no place to call home 
	 wet hungry and no place to eat

she said i care for you daddy 
	 but i love no man better than i do myself 
 but i have a mind to care 
	 a heart to love like anyone else

the wolves howled at midnight 
	 wild ox moaned till day 
 the man in the moon looked down on us 
	 but had nothing to say



i get up early every morning 
	 to toil the whole day through 
 baby it wouldn't be so hard 
	 if i was getting up from beside of you

i'm so lonesome without you baby 
	 i can't be satisfied 
 aren't you a little lonesome for me too 
	 so we can both be pacified

your hugs are so shocking 
	 your eyes tell me yes 
 and you don't store it to me 
	 that's what makes my happiness

i'm not lying baby 
	 you were always really mine 
 and if i don't see you soon 
	 i'll sure be found crying

right back to dallas 
	 i got to be on my way 
 i'm going to let that texas special 
	 drop me in southern u s a

right or wrong 
	 i must be with my little southern chocktaw 
 i don't know that she loves me 
	 but still she calls me her southpaw



i'm black and i'm evil 
	 and i did not make myself 
 if my man don't have me 
	 he won't have nobody else

i've got to buy me a bulldog 
	 he'll watch me while i sleep 
 because i'm so black and evil 
	 that i might make a midnight creep

i believe to my soul 
	 the lord has got a curse on me 
 because every man i get 
	 a no-good woman steals him from me

even as i lay down at night 
	 behind you lies an empty space 
 and you wish on every no-good star 
	 bring here your baby to me



oh the judge he sentenced me 
	 and the clerk he wrote it down 
 my man sat and stared before you babe 
	 that you are county farm bound

oh six months in jail 
	 and a month on the county farm 
 if my man hadn't a-been in the jug 
	 he would help with my bond

i worked hard on the county farm 
	 tried to forget my man 
 and some day he's going to be sorry 
	 he treated me this a-way

i've got to build me a scaffold 
	 just to hang myself 
 because the man i'm loving 
	 i don't care where he follow me



my man my man 
	 treats me so lowdown 
 anything i do 
	 he like to leave his mind

i love my man 
	 but he loves somebody else 
 i think i'm a big fool 
	 he'll keep on wearing my

ever get ready for lay down 
	 and think about your man at night 
 and you will get to twisting and turning 
	 and you couldn't lay just right

my babe turned to me 
	 with tears running down his face 
 says i'm sorry for you woman 
	 another woman has taken your place



i was standing on the corner 
	 just between broadway and main 
 a cop walked up 
	 and he laughed ??? me my name

??? 
	 my name was little known myself 
 i'm a good-time woman 
	 and i sure don't have to

he says i'll take you to the station 
	 and see what you will do 
 i'll make him despise you 
	 and he lay

oh he took me to the judge 
	 with my head hanging low 
 and the judge said hold you head up 
	 for you are bound to go



i had a dream last night 
	 babe i can't understand 
 i had a dream i saw some woman 
	 thieving with my man

i tried to be good 
	 but he would not let me be 
 now he is leaving 
	 just to spite me

now you got all my money 
	 still you ain't satisfied 
 and now you got another woman 
	 going to catch the train and ride

you may go babe 
	 you may have your way 
 but when you think of your loving 
	 i know that you cannot behave



baby when i was all down and out 
	 you just could not be found 
 now i have someone to care for me 
	 don't want you hanging around

i have got a regular man here 
	 lord the good kid-man's downtown 
 i can't quit my regular 
	 and i won't throw my kid-man down

lord i quit my kid-man 
	 because i caught him in a lie 
 and all i can hear now 
	 is his moaning his mournful cry

yes he told a little gal 
	 looking in the deep blue sea 
 i am ??? 
	 so don't bring your blues to me



and i'm black and i'm evil 
	 and i did not make myself 
 if my babe don't have me 
	 he won't have nobody there

going to buy me a bulldog 
	 to watch me while i sleep 
 because i'm so black and evil 
	 that i might make a midnight creep

i believe to my soul 
	 the lord have got a curse on me 
 because every meat that i gain 
	 a no-good woman steals him from me

did you ever lay down at night 
	 behind you lies an empty space 
 you will turn over and hug a pillow 
	 where your daddy used to die

	 don't you dare stop at my door

	 surely is one shameful sin 
 i hope when winter comes 
	 they steal coal from her bin

i had a little dog 
	 
 i leant him to my gal 
	 to keep her company

around that chicken coop

 my baby tried to pull off 
	 my derby

she bit my rooster 
	 bit him to the bone 
 i told her 
	 to let my thing alone

 because i'm sick and tired 
	 of all this ice and snow

	 you can bet i'll stay 
 and i ain't going to leave 
	 until that judgment day

i love old memphis 
	 the place where i was born 
 wear my buck??? shoes 
	 and drink my pint of corn

i wrote my gal a letter 
	 way down in tennessee 
 because i was up here hungry 
	 hurry up and ??? to me

 easy kind of walk 
	 reel and rock behind

	 learned me to ride behind 
 you know by that 
	 i got a job any time

	 to the peanut stand 
 my gal got stuck 
	 on the peanut man

you quit me pretty mama 
	 because you couldn't be my boss 
 but a rolling stone 
	 don't gather no moss

just a nickel's worth of meal 
	 a dime's worth of lard 
 will feed every dame 
	 in jack burse yard

	 my gal went to bed 
 she put a pistol 
	 under my head

	 fell on the flea 
 the flea said police 
	 the horse on me

	 to the little red hen

	 since i don't know when



my gal's got something 
	 that i surely like 
 every time she hugs me 
	 it nearly breaks my back

preacher in the pulpit 
	 bobbing up and down 
 sisters in the amen corner 
	 singing let's go round and round

i got a gal 
	 got movements like a cannonball

	 and shimmy right fast 
 if they miss airy movement 
	 it sure is their last

 you want me to roll 
	 from sun to sun

i'm down in prison 
	 all bound in chains 
 cold and dark all around me 
	 no one to go my bail

i've got a mother and father 
	 they were never satisfied with me 
 got a sister and brother 
	 wonder do they think of poor me

i walked in my room 
	 the other night 
 some man walked in 
	 and began to fight

i take my gun 
	 in my right hand 
 holy smokes 
	 i don't know but i killed my man

when i did that 
	 it crossed my head 
 first shot i fired 
	 my man fell dead

the paper came out 
	 and told the news 
 that's what i said 
	 i got those cell bound blues



my man is leaving 
	 crying won't make him stay 
 if crying do any good 
	 i'd cry my poor self away

if i had wings 
	 i'd fly all over the land 
 when i look down 
	 i'd find my old-time man



whole world would be forgived me 
	 if i could just explain 
 the man i love has left me 
	 because i called another man's name

too sad to whisper 
	 too broken-hearted to sing 
 that mean crazy lover 
	 the day i lost that real thing

explain why you left me 
	 and tell me why you went away 
 i'll explain why i need you 
	 and want you back today

i'm so alone without him 
	 ran away with some of the other bad news 
 but i'll never be down-hearted 
	 if i can explain these blues



i'm going to the western union 
	 type the news all down the line 
 because my man's on the wabash 
	 darling and i don't mind dying

my man is so good-looking 
	 and his clothes fit him so cute 
 i cut off his mustache 
	 and bought him a sunday suit

a ??? little devil 
	 got on my man's clothes 
 i wouldn't be so sore 
	 hadn't've stole his drawers

??? 
	 i stepped in the door 
 he started mauling my man 
	 ???ing down to the floor

i got up and killed three women 
	 'fore police got the news 
 because my man's on the wabash 
	 with the rough and tumbling blues



nighttime's falling 
	 the day is almost dawned 
 my man leaves at midnight 
	 don't come back till early morn

the night is dark and dreary 
	 i can't see what to do 
 i wonder why he leaves me 
	 to roar and cry the whole night through

three o'clock in the morning 
	 by the clock hanging on the wall 
 he used to come home at midnight 
	 now he don't come home at all

when day starts to breaking 
	 it seems to bring good news 
 but i'm just broken-hearted 
	 trying to overcome these nighttime blues



i have a man i can't control 
	 i don't know what to do 
 my man left me two this morning 
	 now he's trying to come back at noon

he got up and packed his suit 
	 said he was going along about nine 
 i went to the fortuneteller to find my man 
	 because he lays heavy on my mind

she said your man was on 
	 that 'fore-day scat 
 and that's a different kind 
	 of maltese cat

poor girl i know 
	 your man has done you wrong 
 it's hard to tell 
	 a man is long long gone

he left here riding 
	 left on the cannonball 
 he wasn't so handsome 
	 and so long and tall

i want all you women 
	 to spread the news 
 want you to tell it 
	 to who you choose



you've got to drift to leave me 
	 you're going to leave your home some day 
 you have got me ??? 
	 and memphis is all i've got to say

you can fly up high 
	 you can ??? all alone 
 but when you get to love her 
	 you got to come back to

some fool's born with rickets 
	 some fool's born with pain 
 but i'm here to tell you 
	 when you leave me all is the same

i talk because i'm stubborn 
	 i sing because i'm sick 
 my man is gone and left me 
	 gone to memphis tennessee



ain't robbed no train 
	 ain't done no hanging crime 
 it's that i'm a slave to the blues 
	 even ??? that man of mine

blues do tell me 
	 do i have to die a slave 
 do you hear me screaming 
	 you're going to take me to my grave

if i could break these chains 
	 and let my worried heart go free 
 well it's too late now 
	 the blues have made a slave of me

you see me raving 
	 you hear me crying 
 oh lord 
	 this wounded heart of mine

folks i'm a-grieving 
	 from my head to my shoes 
 i'm a good-hearted woman 
	 but still i'm chained to the blues



woke up this morning 
	 looking for my darn old shoes 
 because mama's going home 
	 singing the bessemer blues

apple sugar papa 
	 how come you do me like you do 
 i've done everything you asked me 
	 trying to get along with you

i went in the water 
	 walked through ice and snow 
 but from now on papa 
	 i won't be your dog no more

electric all right 
	 and light shine nice and bright 
 but i'd rather be in memphis 
	 reading by a candle light



tell my dad 
	 i'm going to leave my home 
 now i'm going i'm going 
	 and it won't be long

tell my dad 
	 i won't be home tonight

	 said i'm not treated right

lordy lord 
	 have mercy on poor me 
 give me somebody 
	 to let my heart go free

i'm leaving now 
	 i'm sorry we have to part 
 because you like 
	 to break my aching heart



i've got a man 
	 he had a hound 
 chase everything 
	 that's going around

	 that high brown stuff 
 i cry brother 
	 that's enough

so take me to the basement 
	 that's as low as i can go 
 i want something lowdown 
	 daddy want it nice and slow

i will shimmy 
	 from a to z 
 if you'll play 
	 that thing for me



i want all you women 
	 to listen to me 
 don't trust your man 
	 no further than your eyes can see

i trusted my man 
	 with my best friend 
 but that was a bad bargain 
	 in the end

he'll say that he loves you 
	 and swear that it's true 
 the very next minute 
	 he'll turn his back on you

just feed your daddy 
	 with a long-handled spoon 
 keep showing you love him 
	 morning night and noon

sometimes your heart will ache 
	 and almost bust 
 that's why 
	 there's no daddy good enough to trust

he'll stay with you in the winter 
	 whilst your money is long 
 come out in the summer 
	 you'll find your pig will be gone



i'm going away 
	 i'm going to stay 
 i'll find a man 
	 i love some day

i got my ticket 
	 clothes in my hand 
 trying to find 
	 that southbound man

i'm going to ride 
	 till i find that southbound man 
 going to keep a-riding 
	 till i shake hands with my man

i'm going away 
	 i'm going to stay 
 i'll come back 
	 for my daddy some day

i'm going away 
	 i'm going to stay 
 i long for my daddy 
	 somewhere



i love my brownskin 
	 indeed i do 
 but there was no use 
	 tell me thing or two

i'm going to tell you 
	 what i went and done 
 i give him all my money 
	 just to have some fun

he told me that he loved me 
	 loved me so 
 if i would marry him 
	 i needn't to work no more

now i'm grieving 
	 almost dying 
 just because i didn't know 
	 that he was lying

i've got to go to work now 
	 get another start 
 work is the thing 
	 that's breaking my heart



i rambled till i'm tired

	 is mighty bad 
 it's the worst old habit

	 cocaine is good

	 down in minglewood

i love my whiskey 
	 and i love my gin 
 but the way i love my coke

	 to give me ease 
 strut your stuff 
	 long as you please

	 now she treats me like a lowdown dog

tombstone's my pillow 
	 graveyard going to be my bed 
 blue sky's going to be my blanket

 oh hollering and screaming 
	 where that long-gone man of mine



i said hey hey insurance man 
	 quit knocking on my door 
 because i'm four months behind 
	 and you ought to know i ain't going to sell that old insurance no more

well the last time i seed you 
	 i give you a five dollar bill 
 and the next time i see you 
	 you was running three or four whiskey stills

that's why i said please 
	 please stop knocking on my door 
 because i'm going to enjoy my simple straight life 
	 and i ain't going to sell that old insurance no more

well you know you didn't even see me 
	 when i was lying sick on my bed 
 you haven't done no ways 
	 like that old policy read



gee but it's hard to love someone 
	 when that someone don't love you 
 i'm so disgusted heart-broken too 
	 i've got those down-hearted blues

once i was crazy about a man 
	 he mistreated me all the time 
 the next man i get has got to promise me 
	 to be mine all mine

trouble trouble 
	 i've had it all my days 
 it seem like trouble 
	 going to follow me to my grave

i ain't never loved 
	 but three men in my life 
 my father my brother 
	 the man that wrecked my life

it may be a week 
	 it may be a month or two 
 but the day you quit me honey 
	 it's coming home to you

i've got the world in a jug 
	 the stopper's in my hand 
 i'm going to hold it 
	 until you men come under my command



thirty days in jail 
	 with my back turned to the wall 
 look here mr jail-keeper 
	 put another gal in my stall

i don't mind being in jail 
	 but i got to stay there so long so long 
 when every friend i had 
	 is done shook hands and gone

you better stop your man 
	 from tickling me under my chin 
 because if he keeps on tickling 
	 i'm sure going to beg him on in

good morning blues 
	 blues how do you do 
 say i just come here 
	 to have a few words with you



ticket agent 
	 ease your window down 
 because my man's done quit me 
	 and tried to leave this town

i'd rather see 
	 this whole world sloppy drunk 
 than to see my man 
	 starting in to pack his trunk

if he don't want me 
	 he had no right to stall 
 i can get more men 
	 than a passenger train can haul

he stole my money 
	 and he pawned my clothes 
 and which a-way my daddy went 
	 the gypsy only knows

i hate a man 
	 that don't play fair and square 
 because you can get a crooked daddy 
	 most anywhere



i went down to the river 
	 sat beneath a willow tree 
 the blues dropped on those willow leaves 
	 and it rolled right down on me

i went up on the mountain 
	 high as any gal could stand 
 and looked down on that engine 
	 that took away my loving man

i heard the whistle blowing 
	 the fireman ring the bell 
 they taking away that willow tree 
	 that give me this weeping spell

when you broken-hearted 
	 and your man is out of town 
 go to the river 
	 take a chair and sit down

and if he don't come back to you 
	 i tell you what to do 
 just jump right overboard 
	 because he ain't no more to you

folks i love my man 
	 i kiss him morning noon and night 
 i wash his clothes and keep him clean 
	 and try to treat him right

now he's gone and left me 
	 after all i tried to do 
 the way he treats me girls 
	 he'll do the same thing to you



i hate to see 
	 the evening sun go down 
 it makes me think 
	 on on my last go-round

feeling tomorrow 
	 like i feel today 
 i'll pack my grip 
	 and make my get-away

st louis woman 
	 wears diamond ring 
 pulls a man around 
	 by her apron strings

wasn't for powder 
	 and this store-bought hair 
 the man i love 
	 wouldn't go nowhere



when i was young 
	 nothing but a child 
 all you men 
	 tried to drive me wild

now 
	 i'm growing old 
 and i got what it takes 
	 to get all of you men told

my mama says i'm reckless 
	 my daddy says i'm wild 
 i ain't good-looking 
	 but i'm somebody's angel child

come in pretty papa 
	 mama wants some loving i vow 
 come in pretty papa 
	 mama wants some loving right now



you treated me wrong 
	 i treated you right 
 i worked for you 
	 both day and night

you brag to women 
	 that i was your fool 
 so now 
	 i got them sobbing-hearted blues

the sun's going to shine 
	 in my back door some day 
 it's true i love you 
	 but i won't take mistreatment anymore

all i want is your picture 
	 it must be in a frame 
 when you go 
	 i can see you just the same

i'm going to start walking 
	 because i got a wooden pair of shoes 
 going to keep on walking 
	 until i lose these sobbing-hearted blues



now i've tried hard 
	 to treat him kind 
 but it seems to me 
	 his love is gone blind

the man i've got 
	 must have lost his mind 
 the way he quits me 
	 i can't understand

i'm going to find myself 
	 another man 
 because the one i've got 
	 have done gone cold in hand



look a-here daddy 
	 i want to tell you please get out of my sight 
 i'm playing quits now 
	 right from this very night

you've have your day 
	 don't stand around and frown 
 you've been a good old wagon 
	 daddy but you done broke down

now you better go to the blacksmith's shop 
	 and get yourself overhauled 
 there ain't nothing about you 
	 to make a good woman fall

nobody wants a baby 
	 when a real man can be found 
 you've been a good old wagon 
	 daddy but you done broke down

when the sun is shining 
	 it's time to make hay 
 i ??? operate 
	 you can't make that wagon pay

when you were in your prime 
	 you loved to run around 
 you've been a good old wagon 
	 honey but you done broke down

there's no need to cry 
	 and make a big joke 
 this man has taught me more about loving 
	 than you will ever know

he is the king of loving 
	 this man deserve a crown 
 he's a good old wagon 
	 daddy and he ain't broke down



ever since miss suzie johnson 
	 lost her jockey lee 
 there's been much excitement 
	 and more to be

you can hear her moaning 
	 moaning night and morn 
 she's wondering 
	 where her easy rider's gone



folks up north 
	 you all have heard the blues 
 but this is the one 
	 you like to hear the news

if you go down there 
	 you have no time to lose 
 just go uptown 
	 and buy a new pair of shoes

folks down there 
	 they drinks a lots of booze 
 you can ??? 
	 just what you choose

down there 
	 they strut their stuff 
 they way they strut 
	 is really no bluff



listen people 
	 if you want to hear 
 a story told 
	 about a brave engineer

j c holmes 
	 was the rider's name 
 a heavy weight woman 
	 with a hearty fate

j c said 
	 with a smile so fine 
 woman gets tired 
	 of one man all the time

	 if you have to hide 
 if the train go and leave 
	 you got a mule to ride

in the second cabin 
	 set miss alice bry 
 want to ride 
	 with mr j c or die

i ain't good-looking 
	 and i don't dress fine 
 but i'm a rambling woman 
	 with a rambling mind

just then 
	 the conductor hollered all aboard 
 and the porter said 
	 we've got a load

look a-here son 
	 we ought to been gone 
 i feel like riding 
	 if it's all night long

j c said 
	 just before he died 
 two more roads 
	 he wanted to ride

everybody wondered 
	 what road it could be 
 he said the southern pacific 
	 and the santa fe

j c said 
	 i don't feel right 
 i saw my gal 
	 with a man last night

soon as i get 
	 enough steam just right 
 i been mistreated 
	 and i don't mind dying



let me tell you daddy 
	 mama ain't going to sit and grieve 
 pack up your duff 
	 and get ready to leave

	 long enough 
 so now 
	 i'm going to call your bluff

on certain things 
	 i'm going to call your hand 
 so now daddy 
	 here's my plan

	 nowhere in this land 
 so let me tell you people 
	 about this memphis man

 but he's the playingest fool 
	 on that memphis boat

	 around that doggone horn

 there's enough trouble 
	 to make a poor girl wonder where she want to go

then they rowed a little boat 
	 about five miles across the pond 
 i packed all my clothes throwed them in 
	 and they rolled me along

when it thunders and lightning 
	 and the wind begin to blow 
 there's thousands of people 
	 ain't got no place to go

then i went and stood 
	 up on some high old lonesome hill 
 and looked down on the house 
	 where i used to live

backwater blues 
	 done caused me to pack up my things and go 
 because my house fell down 
	 and i can't live there no more

 there ain't no place 
	 for a poor old girl to go



now listen honey 
	 while i say

	 how you could blow 
 he'd let you lead 
	 his band i know

 my new man had left me 
	 just a room and an empty bed

	 got the best one i could find 
 so he could grind my coffee 
	 because he had a brand new grind

he's a deep-sea diver 
	 with a stroke that can't go wrong 
 he can touch the bottom 
	 and his wind holds out so long

he knows how to thrill me 
	 and he thrills me night and day 
 he's got a new way of loving 
	 almost takes my breath away

	 and i told my gal friend lou 
 by the way she's raving 
	 she must have gone and tried it too

i carried my friends 
	 out for a good time 
 buying bootleg liquor 
	 champagne and wine

i'm going to the station 
	 and catch the fastest train that goes 
 i'm going back south 
	 where the weather suits my clothes

because my mama told me 
	 and my daddy told me too 
 don't go north 
	 and let them men make a fool out of you

because their love's like water 
	 it turns off and on 
 time you think you've got them 
	 it turned off and gone

i'm going back south 
	 if i wear out ninety-nine pair of shoes 
 because i'm broke-down-hearted 
	 got those down-south blues



all night blues 
	 ever ever on my mind 
 i've got those all night blues 
	 feel like catching some old train and flying

i felt so low

	 beat that thing 
 that you have come 
	 to have to plink



folks i'll tell 
	 that he's not my regular man 
 but he loves me better 
	 than my regular can

early in the morning 
	 late at night 
 he gives me plenty loving 
	 treats his mama right



you said you want to leave me 
	 at the door 
 i've been disappointed 
	 many times before

i'm going up on the mountain 
	 to watch the sinking sun 
 ain't found nobody else to love me 
	 like my loving daddy done



don't never tell nobody 
	 what your perfect good man can do 
 you just get them anxious 
	 to try some of his good points too

	 and two pretty gold crowns 
 he's got torro hair

	 please send me back my man

uncle sam has told me 
	 that things are ??? around 
 he took all the booze away 
	 and my good brown from town



some day you'll want me 
	 and it won't be long 
 then you'll be sorry 
	 you ever done me wrong

you'll miss my kindness 
	 most everywhere 
 no one to love you 
	 no one to care

there'll be no sunshine 
	 always rain 
 then you going to want me back 
	 once again

then you'll remember 
	 miss smith's old song 
 some day you'll want me 
	 and it won't be long

	 don't keep me waiting so long 
 hot papa 
	 you know you're treating me wrong

 i'm just carrying a brick 
	 for you a brickbat

now your ninety-nine degrees 
	 would be just cool 
 if you were trying 
	 to play me for a fool



you only had 
	 a boot and a shoe 
 until 
	 i fell in love with you

they will think 
	 the world is coming to an end 
 it will only be the end 
	 of one of my trifling men

don't you say you won't 
	 because you surely will 
 because mama's going to stop you 
	 with a blue steel bill



i don't want nobody 
	 i want the world to know 
 when i'm with a fellow 
	 it's strictly for making dough

i'll leave a fellow standing 
	 till his money's gone 
 and tell him that he's nothing 
	 but a pure greenhorn

i had a fellow take me 
	 all around the town 
 and if he ask to kiss me 
	 i would knock him down



oh good-looking papa 
	 where have you been so long 
 oh dough-spreading papa 
	 you got your habits on

when you went away 
	 you didn't have a thing 
 now you come back 
	 with clothes and diamond rings

you went west 
	 and bought a beautiful home 
 you are looking good 
	 as sure as you're born

you were sweet papa 
	 without a doubt 
 but there is nothing doing 
	 what you are thinking about



i went to the race track 
	 my man on derby won 
 give the money to another gal 
	 and wouldn't give me none

you don't know 
	 you don't know my mind 
 when you see me laughing 
	 laughing to keep from crying

i said now papa 
	 can you stand to see me cry 
 he said yes woman 
	 i could stand to see you die

fed my daddy 
	 with plenty of jellyroll 
 pull the shoes off my feet 
	 let me out in the cold



he ain't worth the salt 
	 that goes in his bread 
 he is one third living 
	 and three third dead

he hangs his britches 
	 down on the floor 
 and wears his shoes and socks 
	

when the preacher doing 
	 the hands in hands 
 the fool sat there 
	 too tired to stand



railroad take me back 
	 got the thirty-first street blues 
 please don't jump the track 
	 i ain't got no time to lose

can't get nothing 
	 while roving around 
 but it's all gravy 
	 in my home town

ashes to ashes 
	 dust to dust 
 new york don't get me 
	 chicago must



war horse papa 
	 how come you do me like you do 
 war horse papa 
	 you can't be true

	 that's seven going to ride in a hack 
 war horse papa 
	 but six is coming back

war horse papa 
	 i'm too good a girl 
 war horse papa 
	 you know you can't be true



mean papa turn in your key 
	 because you don't live here no more 
 mean papa just let me be 
	 stay away from my door

she can cheat murder 
	 
 but you just cheat 
	 away a beautiful home

i'm leaving town 
	 i sure don't want to go 
 i think there'll be trouble 
	 and i had better go



it seems to me 
	 as if i'm all broke down 
 since i lost all my change 
	 i lost my sealskin brown



your head will hang low 
	 and your heart will ache 
 you are fattening a frog 
	 for a vampire snake

rave about the things 
	 your loving man can do 
 some other woman 
	 sure to take him away from you



got the backwoods blues 
	 but i don't want to go back home 
 got the blues so bad 
	 for the place that i came from

ought to see my beau 
	 but it's way too far 
 to ride in a ??? 
	

got the backwoods blues 
	 for the place way down in 'bam 
 got the blues 
	 but i'm going to stay here where i am

going to stay right here 
	 just where i'm at 
 where there ain't no grinning 
	 and snatching off my hat

got the backwoods blues 
	 for the folks i left down home 
 i got the blues 
	 for them poor old folks alone

 
 yes i'm going down there 
	 i'm going to stay



my man's on the ocean 
	 bobbing up and down 
 he belongs to uncle sam 
	 but he's always on my mind

i've got the blues 
	 for the deep blue sea 
 nothing but a tear 
	 can satisfy me

no automobile 
	 can change my mind 
 i feel like catching 
	 a airplane and flying

when i hear 
	 that whistle blow 
 i know 
	 the ship is near ashore

ain't but one man in this world 
	 that can satisfy me 
 that's the man that keeps rocking 
	 on the deep blue sea



i was born in texas 
	 but i didn't stay 
 a cruel little daddy 
	 throwed me right away

i brought my man here 
	 tried to treat him right 
 started fighting over a woman 
	 stayed out every day and night

what's the use of trying 
	 i said trying trying to be kind 
 when the one you love 
	 haven't got you on his mind

i stood at the station i said station 
	 saw my man leaving town 
 when that man quit me 
	 that's what brought me down

talk about texas i mean texas 
	 texas people are your friends 
 when one don't want you 
	 the other one will take you in



the man i love 
	 got lowdown ways for two 
 that's why i'm hanging 
	 and i'm lowdown too

he ain't no orchard 
	 and i ain't trying to be 
 and you can't make 
	 no orchard out of me

every day 
	 i get as low as a coat 
 for my home ain't here 
	 it's further down the road

in ??? mississippi 
	 where my folks are at 
 and colored folks don't live 
	 much lower down than that

my papa's name is low 
	 with a zero if you please 
 and he can kiss my mammy 
	 without bending his knees

so please keep your alley 
	 take the air if you please 
 but my eye is at the ??? 
	 in the basement blues



for years you dog me around 
	 but now is the time 
 to walk up and tell you 
	 what's on my mind

i'm going to get me a daddy 
	 to treat me right 
 one who will come home 
	 and sleep every night

there's a fire in my range 
	 bakes nice and brown 
 all i need is some good daddy 
	 turn my damper down



i hate to hear 
	 that engine blow boo hoo 
 every time i hear it blowing 
	 i feel like riding too

got the freight train blues 
	 i've got boxcars on my mind 
 going to leave this town 
	 because my man is so unkind

i'm going away 
	 just to wear you off my mind 
 and i may be gone 
	 for a doggone long long time

i asked the brakeman 
	 let me ride the blinds 
 the brakeman said 
	 clara you know this train ain't mine

when a woman gets the blues 
	 she goes to her room and hides 
 when a man gets the blues 
	 he catches a freight train and rides



he trails me like a bloodhound 
	 he's quicker than a snake 
 he follows right behind me 
	 every crooked turn i make

i'm stubborn and i'm hateful 
	 i'd die before i'd run 
 i'd drink carbolic acid 
	 and i'd poke a gatling gun

i live down in the valley 
	 right by a hornets' nest 
 where lions bears and tigers 
	 all come to take their rest



i received a letter 
	 that my man was dying 
 i caught the first train 
	 and went back home a-flying

he wasn't dead 
	 but he was slowly dying 
 and just to think of him 
	 i just can't keep from crying

i followed my daddy 
	 to the burying ground 
 i watched the pallbearers 
	 slowly let him down

that was the last time 
	 i saw my daddy's face 
 mama loves you sweet papa 
	 but i just can't take your place



all day long i'm worried 
	 all night long i'm blue 
 i'm so awfully lonesome 
	 i don't know what to do

so i ask the doctor 
	 see if you can find 
 something in your practice 
	 to pacify my mind

let me tell you doctor 
	 why i'm in misery 
 once i had a love 
	 he went away from me

been to see the gypsy 
	 hoodoo doctors too 
 shook their heads and told me 
	 nothing they could do

like a little baby 
	 all day long i cry 
 and if you can't cure me 
	 i'm just as sure to die

give me something poison 
	 doctor won't you please 
 then i'll sign a paper 
	 died with heart disease



steel-driving sam 
	 steel-driving man of mine 
 he works on the railroad 
	 making that railroad tie

there ain't nobody 
	 who lives in 'bam 
 who can make a hammer ring 
	 like my man sam

he swings a mean hammer 
	 just as sure as you are born 
 because he can't drive steel 
	 with a doggone horn

steel-driving sam 
	 steel-driving man of mine 
 he works on the railroad 
	 on that old southern line

he wouldn't know his name 
	 printed on a wall 
 in boxcar letters 
	 that's as long as he is tall

but steel-driving sam 
	 steel-driving man of mine 
 he works on the railroad 
	 daylight-savings time



he works all day 
	 with all his might 
 and brings me his money 
	 every saturday night

he don't talk much 
	 he's a hard-boiled man 
 but i keep him eating 
	 right out of my hand

he digs in a ditch 
	 full of mud and slime 
 and when it ain't raining 
	 he's making back time

he eats his supper 
	 throws his clothes on the floor 
 and he's up every morning 
	 at half past four



i've got those broken busted blues 
	 i feel bad 
 i've got those can't be trusted blues 
	 gee i'm sad



oh the gale is raging 
	 and my ship without a sail 
 if the wind keeps on a-blowing 
	 i won't be left to tell the tale

oh the ship is sinking 
	 and the line in such a mess 
 and my crew is done deserted 
	 i got to stick here to the last

oh i don't mind drowning 
	 but the water is so cold 
 if i must leave this good world 
	 i want to leave it brave and bold

mama's shipwrecked shipwrecked 
	 she ain't got no time to lose 
 lord if someone don't save me 
	 i'll go down singing the shipwreck blues



i give him beer 
	 then a glass of ale 
 for in this time tomorrow 
	 i'll be laying in the county jail

three months in jail 
	 ain't no long long time 
 the man i love 
	 he made ninety-nine

the jurymen sit all night 
	 ??? from eight to three 
 and the verdict was 
	 let the poor gal go free

i sit in the courthouse 
	 with my face hid in my hands 
 and it all on account 
	 of one trifling man



you take a southbound regular 
	 you ride my weary blues away 
 because my heart is getting weaker 
	 and i'm sinking lower and lower every day

to find myself a blue steel 
	 i mean a blue steel blade 
 if i find her with my john 
	 i'll slice and i'll cut and send her to her grave



i sold some jelly 
	 to a man named will 
 oh by all means 
	 i had a jellyroll mill

jellyroll every morning 
	 jellyroll at night 
 he couldn't get my jelly 
	 want to fuss and fight

i just come here 
	 to get you told 
 don't let him catch you 
	 messing with my jellyroll

let me tell you one thing 
	 about sweet jellyroll 
 you can tell that jelly 
	 and it's never been sold

i'll tell you one thing 
	 about the jellyroll mill 
 if you have to have jelly 
	 you won't have to steal

	 your running around 
 if you come home 
	 and your mama can't be found

	 without a dime 
 than to be in chicago 
	 simply wasting my time

i'm going to third alley 
	 and bring my rider home 
 because these women in third alley 
	 won't let my rider alone

	 where in the world i prowl 
 nobody ever gets a chance to see me 
	 but they all hear me when i howl

	 with her mother standing by her side 
 and that's the reason i'm howling

	 and act like you don't want to see

i'm that hungry wolf 
	 and the ground is where i dug my cave 
 i leave prowling just at dawn 
	 and get back in the morning just a while before day

i stroll through dark places 
	 threatening to do my part 
 with blood in my eye 
	 and malice in my heart

in places i used to go 
	 i ain't been there i been blowed out by the wind 
 i did think one more time 
	 that i just about come to my end

i can howl like a wolf 
	 and i can bark just like a dog 
 i can prowl and do good 
	 because i sleeps in a hollow log

most times when i get hungry 
	 i'm like a [drunk] man acting a clown 
 then my eyes start to jumping 
	 then i'm dangerous as a doggone lion

you gobblers keep on gobbling 
	 you roosters watch your setting hen 
 old wolf is hungry now i'm going to do most 'napping 
	 than i done since god knows when



i'm harmless as i can be 
	 i stays out of all people's way 
 i'm just a little old toad 
	 i'm going to hop back to my home some day

i've hop down in your basement 
	 don't mean to harm a single soul 
 i shake all of your ashes 
	 then shovel you in some brand new coal

i don't have no friend 
	 by myself i'm always on the road 
 just let me hop you one time mama 
	 and you'll keep me for your little old toad

mom would you let a poor little old toad frog 
	 hop down in your water pond 
 i'd dive down and come right out 
	 and i won't stay in your water long

but i know for myself 
	 and your front yard is where i get my load 
 way you talk you like my hopping 
	 why don't you keep me for your little toad

mama do you know one thing 
	 your water tank is just deep enough 
 i can dive down to the bottom 
	 and take my time and tread right back up



some people tell me 
	 god takes care of old folks and fools 
 but since i been born 
	 he must a-have changed his rules

i used to ask a question 
	 then answer that question myself 
 about when i was born 
	 wonder was there any more mercy left

look like here of late 
	 i've been crying both day and night 
 everybody talks about me 
	 and nobody don't treat me right

you know until six months ago 
	 i hadn't prayed a prayer since god knows when 
 now i'm asking god every day 
	 to please forgive me for my sin

you know this must be the devil i'm serving 
	 i know it can't be jesus christ 
 because i asked him to save me 
	 and look like he's trying to take my life

my health is gone now 
	 and left me with the sickness blues 
 people it don't seem like to me 
	 that god takes care of old folks and fools



they tell me seven sisters in new orleans 
	 they can really fix a man up right 
 and i'm headed for new orleans louisiana 
	 i'm traveling both day and night

i hear them say 
	 the oldest sister look like she's just twenty-one 
 and said she can look right in your eyes 
	 and tell you exactly what you want done

they tell me they been hung 
	 been bled and been crucified 
 but i just want enough help 
	 to stand on the water and rule the tide

it's bound to be seven sisters 
	 because i've heard it by everybody else 
 of course i'd love to take their word 
	 but i'd rather go and see for myself

when i leave the seven sisters 
	 i'm piling stones all around 
 and go to my baby and tell her 
	 there's another seven-sister man in town

good morning seven sisters 
	 just thought i'd come down and see 
 will you build me up where i'm torn down 
	 and make me strong where i'm weak



i went to new orleans louisiana 
	 just on account of something i heard 
 the seven sisters told me everything i wanted to know 
	 and they wouldn't let me speak a word

now it's sarah minnie bertha 
	 holly dolly betty and jane 
 you can't know them seven sisters apart 
	 because they all looks just the same

the seven sisters sent me away happy 
	 around the corner i met another little girl 
 she looked at me and smiled 
	 and said go devil and destroy the world

seven times you hear the seven sisters 
	 will visit me [all] in my  sleep 
 and they said i won't have no more trouble 
	 and said i'll live twelve days in a week

boy go down in louisiana 
	 and get the lead right out of your bean 
 if seven sisters can't do anything in louisiana 
	 bet you'll have to go to new orleans



when i had money baby 
	 you was good to me 
 but now i'm broke and hungry 
	 and you cruel as you can be

last night you called me 
	 a lowdown dirty name 
 woke up monday morning 
	 and done the same old thing

it won't be long 
	 before god will bring his day 
 give me my shirt and tie baby 
	 and i'll get on my way

you in good health now baby 
	 and good and strong 
 but before long baby 
	 you'll be down to skin and bone

i'm going now baby 
	 kiss me goodbye 
 i know you don't love me baby 
	 and i don't see how you cry

reason i'm leaving you 
	 you dog me all the time 
 look like it do you good somebody 
	 the day they saw me crying



since you gone 
	 and got so rough 
 i won't stand 
	 for that caveman stuff



don't you leave me here 
	 a good gal i've been 
 if you ain't coming back sweet papa 
	 leave a dime for gin

you can dog me around 
	 baby i don't care 
 but here's a thing i got to say 
	 just quit me if you dare

the boat's up the river 
	 and it ain't coming down 
 but i believe to my soul 
	 my man is alabama bound

if you buy your ticket 
	 papa you better buy two 
 because if you try to leave me here 
	 the way will sure get you

so if you got a bad man 
	 and he won't do right 
 take a chair and break it over his doggone head 
	 and walk the streets all night



there's a man in town 
	 who's called the ladies' lover now 
 keeps his pockets full of mirrors 
	 he's the pup's bow-wow

he went into a cabaret 
	 to see miss jenny dance 
 jenny stepped right up 
	 and said you have no chance

there'll be no doings here 
	 before you pay 
 no dancing prancing 
	 until the break of day

i know there's lots of girlies 
	 you may charm 
 and long to hold them 
	 close up right in your arms

but here's a lesson 
	 that was taught to me 
 you cannot eat and sleep 
	 on mirth and glee

goodbye 
	 and please don't call at all 
 there'll be no preachers 
	 at miss jenny's ball

 lord you treats me 
	 just like my heart is made of steel

my baby 
	 don't see why i pone thee no more 
 lord i believe to my soul 
	 that she's got the man next door

i woke up this morning 
	 just as sick as i could be 
 now nothing but these blues 
	 almost killing poor me

i spoke hard words to my mother 
	 even to my dear old dad too 
 which i wouldn't have spoken

	 when it blowing your way



i don't want no woman 
	 partner that wants every man in town

	 mama and let you have your way

	 she don't do no way to comfort me 
 she know that ain't no way 
	 for a sweet little wife to be

i'm in a worse fix now baby 
	 than i ever been before 
 i'd rather be on the north pole 
	 living in the ice and snow

last time my baby quit me 
	 i say i didn't no more want her around 
 but every time i see her smiling face 
	 my kind-hearted feeling come down

love will make you do things 
	 that you swear that you would not do 
 you know if you ever been in love 
	 what i'm say ain't nothing strange to you

i'm a hard-luck man 
	 just as hard-luck as i can be 
 if i didn't have good friends 
	 i don't know what would become of me



mmm i done you wrong 
	 but i won't do that no more 
 you taught me a lesson 
	 about a mr so-and-so

my babe come running 
	 [with a, she had] marriage license in her hand 
 you say i ain't hardly got the heart to tell you 
	 but i have got another man

i said bye bye 
	 bye bye girl friend bye bye

 lord the women out there 
	 don't mean no one man no good

i'm leaving st louis 
	 i'm going out grand avenue 
 i got to go to memphis 
	 something over there that i want to do

when i hit grand [avenue] 
	 look like my troubles just begun 
 lord it breaks my heart 
	 to sing about highway sixty-one

i felt so blue 
	 while i was out on that lonely highway 
 i say i'm riding now 
	 but maybe my trouble will end some sweet day

i can stand right here 
	 look [down] on beale avenue

 to face this cruel world 
	 world all by myself



i have learned my lesson 
	 believe me i am through 
 and folks i am not joking 
	 when i sing these down-south blues

i'm going to the station 
	 and get the fastest train that goes 
 i'm going back south 
	 where the weather suits my clothes

because my mama told me 
	 and my daddy told me too 
 don't go north 
	 and let the men make a fool out of you

i have found out 
	 it doesn't pay to love a northern man 
 can't get them when you want them 
	 catch them when you can

because their love is like a faucet 
	 it turns off and on 
 time you think you've got it

	 and give them all hell

	 and a brownskin do the same

	 that he'll sure love me too

this old cockeyed world 
	 will make your good man treat you mean

	 just like a poor girl he never seen

it's war in ethiopia 
	 and my man won't behave 
 i tell the cockeyed world

 but gambling 
	 is going to be our end

	 and cut up all my clothes 
 and you keep me broke 
	 and tried to put me out-of-doors

we have traveled 
	 the whole round world through 
 there is nothing in this world 
	 i found that pleases you

i love jack of diamonds 
	 but he was a cruel man 
 he would play dice and cards 
	 and his game was old cooncan



my room sure looks lonesome 
	 since my good man been gone 
 i ain't got nobody 
	 that i can call my own

	 but my man don't treat me right 
 he takes all my money 
	 and stays out all night

i'm down today 
	 but i won't be down always 
 because the sun's going to shine 
	 in my back door some day

it's one thing papa 
	 i've decided to do 
 i'm going to find another papa 
	 then i can't use you



wake up man 
	 see how bright the sun does shine 
 get up in that section gang 
	 and bring me up sometime

now he ain't got no teeth 
	 and beard so low as your toe 
 now you know man 
	 you got to bring me up some dough

now the meal in the barrel 
	 is going fast 
 how long man 
	 do you think the powder laws will last

rip van winckle 
	 slept for a long long time 
 but rip van winckle 
	 wasn't no man of mine

i don't want a man 
	 that don't work every day 
 i want a man 
	 that brings home his pay

so get out of that bed 
	 man be on your way 
 you ramble all night 
	 and you sleep all day

so now i'm cross 
	 and man i'm feeling mad 
 because you's the laziest man 
	 that i ever had



i'm standing in this water 
	 wishing i had a boat 
 the only way i see 
	 is take my clothes and float

	 people fleeing for the hills 
 lord the water will obey 
	 if you just say be still

they sent out a law 
	 for everybody to leave town 
 but when i got the news 
	 i was high-water bound

they dynamite the levee

	 baby a chinch can't bite that hard 
 and i asked my baby for fifty cents 
	 she said honey ain't a child in the yard

i'm crying mmm 
	 black snake crawling all in my room 
 i mean some pretty mama 
	 better come and get this black snake soon

now mama that's all right 
	 mama that's all right for you 
 i mean now that's all right pretty mama 
	 most any old any old way you do

now you don't know 
	 you don't worry my mind 
 you keep your black snake worried 
	 and want him most all the time

 
 i'm crying oh now 
	 black snake crawling all on my room



the very thought of sam sinking 
	 that's my cup 
 it's going to be my place 
	 to pick him up



my walk will be different 
	 my talk and my name 
 nothing about me 
	 is going to be the same

i'm going to change my long ??? 
	 for a little short spat 
 i'm going to change my number 
	 where i'm living at

why there's a change in the weather 
	 there's a change in the sea 
 but from now on 
	 there'll be a change in me

i'm going to change my way of living 
	 and that ain't no bluff 
 why i'm thinking about changing 
	 the way i got to strut my stuff



a certain party 
	 that i know 
 offered me a ticket 
	 to chicago

arty wanted to marry me 
	 way last spring 
 even bought me 
	 a great big diamond ring



have you heard it have you heard it 
	 the da da swing 
 it will shake you 
	 it will make you really go insane

everybody 
	 is still obsessed 
 make you watch 
	 your every step

every ??? every ??? 
	 starts to lay them down 
 everybody when they heard it 
	 starts to ???ing around

and i get crazy 
	 as a loon 
 when everybody 
	 hums this tune



now the jump-steady club 
	 they gave a ball 
 and it was held 
	 down at the new hope hall

all the bootleggers 
	 in the town 
 why they brought 
	 that stuff steady along

people came 
	 from far and near 
 to taste the different mixtures 
	 that they handled there

when the jazz band struck up 
	 you'd be surprised 
 everybody in the hall 
	 was goo-goo eyed

they started serving 
	 ??? wine 
 and everything 
	 that was alcohol-lined

chicago pop 
	 and lilac 
 all kinds of pep tonic 
	 went along with the jazz

jamaica gin 
	 to mix with turpentine 
 with black molasses 
	 made it super fine

extract of lemon 
	 and ginger ale 
 sweet patuni with shoe polish 
	 and you're bound for jail

night's awful hot 
	 i was feeling fine 
 to tell the truth 
	 i was out of my mind

but just before 
	 i lost my head 
 i saw them 
	 carry six men out dead

they walked out the window 
	 in the air 
 they called for music 
	 but no jazz band was there

then everybody there 
	 was 
 you could get paralyzed 
	 for fifteen cents

extract of lemon 
	 with ginger ale 
 eat cake with some raisins 
	 and you're bound for jail



it makes me crazy 
	 when you blow it up high 
 and when you bring it down 
	 and swing it side to side

because when you start to jazz 
	 i get a feeling from the start 
 that gives me such a kicking and a twicking 
	 around my heart



memphis man 
	 comes knocking at the door 
 knocks like 
	 nobody ever knocked before

if you know your business 
	 let him in 
 because he's so different 
	 when loving begins

memphis man 
	 the lovingest man i know 
 loves you 
	 like you never been loved before

love you while he's talking 
	 love you while he sings 
 swing his arms and hands 
	 and a few other things

love you when he's working 
	 love you when he slaves 
 he could write a book 
	 on his loving ways



daddy daddy 
	 please come back to me 
 your mama's lonesome 
	 as she can be

you left [me] at midnight 
	 clock was striking twelve 
 to face this cruel world 
	 well all by myself



you can't do 
	 what my last man did 
 dog me around 
	 and treat me like he did

my last man 
	 tried to drag me down 
 but he was one good man 
	 to have around

	 strikes half past three

	 you wanted to fight 
 because you heard

	 he blacked my eye 
 then left me alone 
	 to sigh and cry

	 and i can't laugh for crying 
 because the man i love 
	 is forever on my mind

he puts candy in my hand 
	 and he calls me his candy doll 
 then he looks at me and cries mama 
	 i mean your sweet old girl

it's so hard to love 
	 another woman's man 
 because you can't get him when you want him 
	 you've got to take him when you can

oh love is like a faucet 
	 that turns off and on 
 because every time you think you've got it 
	 papa it's turned off and gone

life is nothing but a jam 
	 a constant jamboree 
 it jams everybody 
	 now it's about to jam poor me



some people crave for loving 
	 some people crave for gold 
 but craving is just a habit 
	 so i've been told

	 the kind that you won't regret 
  i've got something about this pigmeat 
	 i ain't told you yet

 i was born in the country 
	 but daddy i was raised in town 
  there's nobody there 
	 can beat me from my head on down

 i ain't good-looking 
	 i got no great long hair 
  but i don't have to worry 
	 because i knows pigmeat anywhere

 you can carry it to the mountain 
	 it will be pigmeat there 
  register it poor on china 
	 span the test anywhere



 stood on the corner 
	 till my feet got soaking wet 
  these are the words i said 
	 to each and every man i met

 if you ain't got a dollar 
	 give me a lousy dime 
  i've got to beg and steal 
	 to please that man of mine

 my feets all blistered 
	 just from walking these lonesome streets 
  i've been walking all night 
	 like a police on his beat

 wait a minute mr mr 
	 give me a cigarette 
  stop your calling me in 
	 i've got what you should get

 i've got these streetwalking blues 
	 i ain't got no time to lose 
  i've got to make six dollars 
	 just to buy my man a pair of shoes



 oh the blues ain't nothing 
	 but a woman want to see her man 
  because she wants some loving 
	 you women will understand

 oh the blues ain't nothing 
	 but a lowdown heart disease 
  because loving your man 
	 he's so hard to please

 oh the blues ain't nothing 
	 but a woman loving a married man 
  can't see him when she want to 
	 got to see him when she can

 oh the blues ain't nothing 
	 but a good woman feeling bad 
  always down-hearted 
	 blue disgusted and sad

 oh the blues ain't nothing 
	 but a feeling that will get you down 
  falling out with your man 
	 you feel like leaving town



 the welfare helping people 
	 each and every day 
  but the rent men have put me out 
	 i ain't got no place to stay

 i believe to my soul 
	 i'm just a bad-luck man 
  welfare's helping everybody 
	 but don't give me no helping hand

 i believe i'll go back south 
	 cotton'll be a good price next year 
  i might as well be gone 
	 i ain't doing nothing around here

 now the president's warning people 
	 things will break some day 
  he say everything will be all right 
	 you will have a place to stay

 i believe i'll go back south 
	 raise everything i need 
  if i don't make nothing off my cotton 
	 boss will pay me for my seed



 lord it rained 
	 it rained as far as i could see 
  i wonder what water creature 
	 keep on crawling up on poor me

 like a fool 
	 i gave everything i had for you to you 
  now you've gone and left me 
	 seems like the world is falling on through

 people talk 
	 i can hear them whisper everywhere i go 
  all my friends come to see me 
	 and say well i told you so

 what did i ever do 
	 that made you leave so all alone 
  since you've gone and left me 
	 i do nothing but weep and moan

 every night i pray 
	 for you to walk across my door 
  and i won't be worried 
	 about these stormy weather blues no more



 i ain't got nobody 
	 take me to this train 
  mmm 
	 mmm

 fare you well 
	 if i don't see you no more 
  mmm 
	 lord lord lord lord

 i'm a motherless child 
	 i'm a long ways from home 
  mmm 
	 mmm

	 it don't burn no coal 
  mmm 
	 mmm

	 in pinebluff arkansas 
  she was the sweetest little woman 
	 that you men most ever saw

	 baby with the rising sun

	 going to be some walking done

 my baby she called me 
	 she called me up on the phone 
  she said daddy daddy 
	 i don't see how come you don't hurry home

	 going to bed and moan 
  she said i ain't had no loving daddy 
	 daddy since that you been gone

 well she said i'm tired 
	 daddy of singing these lonesome songs 
  she tired even her daddy 
	 i ain't even had you home

	 daddy hearing my best friend groan 
  she said i declare if you want me daddy 
	 you better hurry home

	 and your gown 
  baby before day 
	 we going to shake them on down

	 than that old whiskey still



 my heart is filled with pain 
	 i believe i can't be trained 
  the woman i love 
	 she had another man

 yon come the train 
	 and i got no change 
  all i can do 
	 just stand and wring my hands

 i don't feel ashamed 
	 standing and wringing my hands at the train 
  i ain't the first man 
	 the train left cold in hand

 now the same big black train 
	 that put me in a strain 
  i'll ride the train 
	 keep the women from spending my change

 i don't see nothing 
	 but hands standing at the train 
  that's the same black train 
	 that left me in this pain

	 and i'm looking for my mother's grave

	 to take my mother's place 
  if i can't find no one

	 and i wished i could see her face 
  i be glad when that day comes 
	 ooo well when these blues drive me away



 never will forget the day 
	 when they had me in parchman jail 
  would no one even come 
	 and go my bail

 so many days 
	 i would be sitting down 
  i would be sitting down 
	 looking down on my clothes

 so many days 
	 when the days would be cold 
  they would carry me out 
	 in the rain and cold

 so many days 
	 when the days would be cold 
  you could stand 
	 and look at the convict tow

 so many days 
	 i would be walking down the road 
  i could hardly walk 
	 with looking down on my clothes

 never will forget the day 
	 when they taken my clothes 
  taken my citizen's clothes 
	 and throwed them away



 when a man gets troubled in mind 
	 he want to sleep all the time 
  he knows if he can sleep all the time

  the wind going to rise

 you didn't mean it baby 
	 you hadn't no right to lie 
  so go baby go 
	 and stay until you die

	 a man by the name of john 
  he's the meanest man 
	 that ever lived under the sun

	 just look what you done done 
  lord you treat me 
	 like my troubles have just begun

 lord you left me worried 
	 that's why i'm all confused 
  that's why i'm singing 
	 these old experience blues



 my heart is painful 
	 i believe my blues are pouring down 
  i feel like sinking 
	 six feet in the lonesome ground

 my heart did pain 
	 when my baby got on the train 
  my heart struck sorrow 
	 it fell like drops of rain

 i've got a baby 
	 that keeps me feeling blue 
  he acts like the weather 
	 i can't tell what he's going to do

 women don't let your man 
	 treat like mine done for me 
  he had me almost crazy 
	 as a doggone girl could be

 delano was a man 
	 who could flag my train for a ride 
  he has me almost crazy 
	 till i was satisfied



 now i went down eighteenth street 
	 didn't have no hat 
  asking all the women 
	 where was my man at

 i'm going to grab me a train 
	 ride it till it stops 
  not going to stay around here 
	 and be a stumbling block

 woke up this morning 
	 at the break of day 
  looked on my pillow 
	 where my man used to lay

 my suitcase was packed 
	 trunk's already home 
  so it won't be long 
	 before your mama be gone

 you caused my heart to weep 
	 you caused it to moan 
  so why fetch me 
	 no train i'm on



 now you grab your partner 
	 large or small 
  and dance her 
	 around the hall

 big fat mama 
	 and i can bend down low 
  just see me do this scoop it 
	 across the floor

  i can get way back 
	 in my knees 
 



 woke up this morning about half past nine 
	 and i just could not keep from crying 
  i was worried about 
	 that stevedore man of mine

 it's raining and it's hailing 
	 storming daddy on the sea 
  now that's the onliest way 
	 to keep my sweet daddy away from me

 i went down to the station 
	 and i could not keep from crying 
  lord a train had my man 
	 and it was fairly flying

 i stole that sweet man of mine 
	 stole him from my best friend 
  and that woman done got lucky 
	 lord and stoled her man back again



 you ever wake up 
	 just about the break of day 
  with your arms around the pillow 
	 where mr so-and-so used to lay

 i'm going away baby 
	 won't be back until fall 
  if i don't win no money 
	 i won't be back at all

 i heard you scratching 
	 early in this room 
  if you don't think i'm leaving 
	 count the days i'll be gone

 if the river was liquor 
	 and i was a duck 
  i would go to the bottom 
	 and i would never come up

 i'm leaving this town 
	 i got on my last pair of shoes 
  walking away from here 
	 these old down the country blues



 early this morning 
	 heard someone calling me 
  it was my baby 
	 that black backbiting bee

 going to take my razor 
	 cut my honeysuckle vine 
  darn black bee 
	 that stole that honey of mine

 rather have my head in alcohol 
	 my body on some railroad track 
  than have that black bee 
	 bite me in my back

 it's raining in my kitchen 
	 lightning on my wall 
  i know by that 
	 some mule is kicking in my stall



 
  scoop it 
	 pretty mama for me



 going to take my gal 
	 to a social dance 
  but i didn't have no seat 
	 in my pants

 give me four dollars 
	 take me in 
  i took the four dollars 
	 and i bought some gin

 i tore my hair 
	 and i walked the streets 
  i wanted to whip 
	 everyone i meet

 along came john 
	 who's my best friend 
  cut his head 
	 till it was a sin

 i shot some craps 
	 to my disgrace 
  i run everybody 
	 out the place

 dice was loaded 
	 made me sore 
  i left four hustlers 
	 lying on the floor

 i went to church 
	 to do the holy roll 
  grabbed me a sister 
	 to convert her soul

 two minutes later 
	 preacher came in 
  she stopped rolling with me 
	 started rolling with him

 i took my cow 
	 to the doctor man 
  something about her 
	 i couldn't understand

 i milked her good 
	 about half past ten 
  didn't give nothing 
	 but a bucket of gin

 i tore up 
	 all my gal's good clothes 
  didn't mean to do it 
	 the good lord knows

 my landlady 
	 is a good old soul 
  i even took 
	 some of her sweet jellyroll

 i went downtown 
	 about half past four 
  stoled two hot dogs 
	 from a butcher store

 got locked up 
	 judge he said 
  take six months 
	 to clear your head

	 was slick as glass 
  i tried to run away 
	 got shot in my yas

 yes i told my gal 
	 to bring me bail 
  get some money 
	 if she have to sell a little coal



 when your gal gets old 
	 she wants to be alone 
  you left a little work 
	 undone at home

 whenever you do it 
	 whatever you should 
  just do your best 
	 to do it good

 when you have a fight 
	 and you didn't win 
  buy a shotgun 
	 start over again

 if you gal come home 
	 she's feeling tight 
  she wants some loving 
	 that very night

 if you feeling bad 
	 because you're on the shelf 
  get some rope 
	 go hang yourself

 if your gal need money 
	 how bad you feel 
  go get some money 
	 if you have to steal

 if your wife leave home 
	 every time you do 
  somebody outside 
	 knows more than you

 when your pal buy your gal 
	 a coca-cola 
  you can bet your life 
	 he's playing her victrola

 the elephant said 
	 when he swallowed the cat 
  got a mouthful of kitty 
	 and it's tight like that



 and it's hey mama 
	 i'm going to leave your town 
  i ain't got no man 
	 to put my arms around

	 throwed in your back yard 
  i wanted to see you mama 
	 but your good man had me barred

	 i caught you with a man 
  baby if i see you regular 
	 mama see me when you can

	 stop on fourth and beale 
  if i can't find roberta 
	 i hope to find lucille



 i said hey baby 
	 i give you your last chance 
  all you do to wear my jacket 
	 but you want to wear my pants

 oh baby 
	 what's the matter now 
  you just a trifling woman 
	 don't mean me no good nohow

 said i give you my money baby 
	 but that don't do no good 
  i bring her supper while you working 
	 that's just what i do

 i said hey 
	 what am i going to do 
  i done everything baby 
	 can't get along with you



 and hey what makes a rooster 
	 crow at the break of day 
  that's to let the rounder know 
	 the workingman is on his way

 hey 
	 he is on his way 
  that's to let the rounder know 
	 the workingman is on his way

 i used to be a lover 
	 baby in my younger days 
  now i'm old and feeble 
	 but i still got my loving ways

	 in my younger days 
  now i'm old and feeble

	 sure is deep and wide 
  i want to cross the river 
	 go down the other side

 so long so long 
	 wolf river so long 
  lord i need somebody 
	 hear me sing this song



 when they bring you 
	 through that gate 
  you wish you hadn't a-done it 
	 but it's just too late

 you might as well laugh 
	 ??? you fall 
  now hollering won't get you nothing 
	 behind the wall

 the prison wall blues 
	 keep rolling across my mind 
  i can't get parole 
	 wish like the governor would quit my time

 i once was lost 
	 but now i'm found 
  i'd leave this place running 
	 but i'm scared of them flop-eared hounds

 this is the highest fence i ever saw 
	 in my life i can't climb 
  this fence will make a high yellow girl turn dark 
	 it make a weak-eyed man go blind

 when i leave these walls 
	 i'll be running ??? a speed 
  you see the bottom of my feet so many times 
	 you think i'm on my knees



 i had an evil-hearted woman 
	 she mistreated me all the time 
  she went away and left me 
	 but she's forever on my mind

 i done her wrong 
	 and i can't deny myself 
  lord i can't love her 
	 and she loving somebody else

	 what she told me one sunny day 
  she said i love you daddy 
	 i can't stand your lowdown ways

 early one morning 
	 about the break of day 
  she told me daddy daddy 
	 i'm going to let you have your way

 i get lonesome 
	 around here by myself 
  thinking about you jesse 
	 you have been with someone else



 lord my mother told me 
	 when i was quite a child 
  that the life that you are living 
	 will kill you after a while

 i just began to realize 
	 the things my mother said 
  since i been down here 
	 and been mistreated this a-way

 i never loved no one woman 
	 hope to god i never will 
  all the attracting women 
	 will get some good man killed

 now i ain't no monkey 
	 and i sure can't climb no tree 
  and i ain't going to let no woman 
	 make no monkey out of me

 now i sent my baby 
	 a brand new twenty dollar bill
