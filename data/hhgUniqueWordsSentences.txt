the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy

and all other arlingtonians for
tea, sympathy and a sofa

far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the west-
ern spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun  many solutions were
suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the
movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole
it wasnt the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy 

many were increasingly of the opinion that theyd all made a big mistake
in coming down from the trees in the rst place 
and then, one thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had
been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people
for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in rickmansworth
suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she
nally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place 

it is also the story of a book, a book called the hitchhikers guide to the
galaxy  not an earth book, never published on earth, and until the terrible
catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any earthman 
in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the
great publishing houses of ursa minor  of which no earthman had ever heard
either 

not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one
 more popular than the celestial home care omnibus, better selling than
fifty more things to do in zero gravity, and more controversial than oolon
colluphids trilogy of philosophical blockbusters where god went wrong,
some more of gods greatest mistakes and who is this god person anyway?
in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the outer eastern rim of the
galaxy, the hitchhikers guide has already supplanted the great encyclopedia
galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for thoughit has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly
inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important
respects 

first, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words dont panic

inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover 

but the story of this terrible, stupid thursday, the story of its extraordi-
nary consequences, and the story of how these consequences are inextricably
intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply  he was about thirty as well,
dark haired and never quite at ease with himself 

on wednesday night it had rained very heavily, the lane was wet and
muddy, but the thursday morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on
arthur dents house for what was to be the last time

it hadnt properly registered with arthur that the council wanted to

knock down his house and build an bypass instead 

at eight oclock on thursday morning arthur didnt feel very good  he
woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window,
saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped o to the bathroom to wash  for a moment
it reected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window  properly ad-
justed, it reected arthur dents bristles  he shaved them o, washed, dried,
and stomped o to the kitchen to nd something pleasant to put in his mouth 

kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coee 
the word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in searchof something to connect with 

the bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one  hed been telling people about it, telling people about it at great
length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed
looks on other peoples faces  it would sort
itself out, hed decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didnt have a
leg to stand on 

fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big

yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path 

mr  more specically he was forty,
fat and shabby and worked for the local council  curiously enough, though
he didnt know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of genghis khan,
though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes
that he had no discernible mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges
left in mr  prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness
about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats  today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had
gone seriously wrong with his job  which was to see that arthur dents
house got cleared out of the way before the day was out 

come o it, mr  you cant lie
in front of the bulldozer indenitely  he tried to make his eyes blaze ercely
but they just wouldnt do it im game, he said, well see who rusts rst 
im afraid youre going to have to accept it, said mr  prosser gripping
his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, this bypass has got to
be built and its going to be built!

first ive heard of it, said arthur, whys it going to be built?
mr  prosser shook his nger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it

away again 

what do you mean, whys it got to be built? he said 

youve got to build bypasses 

bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point a to
point b very fast whilst other people dash from point b to point a very fast 
people living at point c, being a point directly in between, are often given
to wonder whats so great about point a that so many people of point b are
so keen to get there, and whats so great about point b that so many people
of point a are so keen to get there 

mr  point d wasnt anywhere in partic-
ular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points a, b and
c  he didnt know why  he just liked axes  he ushed hotly under the
derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers  obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he
hoped to god it wasnt him 

mr  appropriate time? the rst i
knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday  i asked
him if hed come to clean the windows and he said no hed come to demolish
the house  he didnt tell me straight away of course  first he wiped
a couple of windows and charged me a ver 

but mr  dent, the plans have been available in the local planning oce

for the last nine month 

oh yes, well as soon as i heard i went straight round to see them, yes-
terday afternoon  you hadnt exactly gone out of your way to call attention
to them had you? i mean like actually telling anybody or anything  
on display? i eventually had to go down to the cellar to nd them 
thats the display department with a ashlight 
but look, you found the notice didnt you?
yes, said arthur, yes i did 

it was on display in the bottom of a
locked ling cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door
saying beware of the leopard 
dents house  mr 
im sorry, but i happen to like it 
youll like the bypass  you havent got a leg to stand on and you know
it 

mr  prossers mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind
was for a moment lled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of
arthur dents house being consumed with re and arthur himself running
screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding
from his back  mr  he stuttered for a moment and then pulled
himself together 

mr  have you any idea how much damage

that bulldozer would suer if i just let it roll straight over you?

how much? said arthur 
none at all, said mr  prosser, and stormed nervously o wondering
why his brain was lled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him 

by a curious coincidence, none at all is exactly how much suspicion
the ape-descendant arthur dent had that one of his closest friends was not
descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of
betelgeuse and not from guildford as he usually claimed 
this friend of his had rst arrived on the planet some fteen earth years
previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into earth society 
with, it must be said, some success  for instance he had spent those fteen
years pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough he had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit
on his preparatory research  the information he had gathered had led him
to choose the name ford prefect as being nicely inconspicuous 

he was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspic-
uously handsome  his hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards
from the temples 
there was something very slightly odd about him, but it was dicult to say
what it was  perhaps it was that his eyes didnt blink often enough and
when you talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily
to water on his behalf 

he struck most of the friends he had made on earth as an eccentric, but
a harmless one  an unruly boozer with some oddish habits  for instance he
would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making
fun of any astrophysicist he could nd till he got thrown out 
then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin 

oh, just looking for ying saucers, he would joke and everyone would

laugh and ask him what sort of ying saucers he was looking for  ford would get out of his skull
on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred
phrases that honestly the colour of the ying saucers didnt matter that much
really 

thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would of-
ten ask passing policemen if they knew the way to betelgeuse  the policemen
would usually say something like, dont you think its about time you went
o home sir?

im trying to baby, im trying to, is what ford invariably replied on

these occasions 

in fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into
the night sky was any kind of ying saucer at all  the reason he said green
was that green was the traditional space livery of the betelgeuse trading
scouts 

ford prefect was desperate that any ying saucer at all would arrive soon
because fteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly
somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the earth ford wished that a ying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how
to ag ying saucers down and get lifts from them  he knew how to see the
marvels of the universe for less than thirty altairan dollars a day 

in fact, ford prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable

book the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy 

human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the environs
of arthurs house had settled into a steady routine  it was arthurs accepted
role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands to see his lawyer,
his mother or a good book; it was mr  prossers accepted role to tackle
arthur with the occasional new ploy such as the for the public good talk,
the march of progress talk, the they knocked my house down once you
know, never looked back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and
it was the bulldozer drivers accepted role to sit around drinking coee and
experimenting with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation
to their nancial advantage 
arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see ford

prefect standing above him  well, ive just got all these bulldozers
and things to lie in front of because theyll knock my house down if i dont,
but other than that   well, no not especially, why?

they dont have sarcasm on betelgeuse, and ford prefect often failed to
notice it unless he was concentrating 
for a few seconds ford seemed to ignore him, and stared xedly into the
sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car 

weve got to talk, he said urgently 
look, dont you understand? shouted arthur  well he can do it while youre away cant

he? he asked 

but i dont want him to!
ah 
look, whats the matter with you ford? said arthur  listen to me  ive got to tell you the
most important thing youve ever heard  ive got to tell you now, and ive
got to tell you in the saloon bar of the horse and groom 

but why?
because you are going to need a very sti drink 
ford stared at arthur, and arthur was astonished to nd that his will
was beginning to weaken  he didnt realize that this was because of an old
drinking game that ford learned to play in the hyperspace ports that served
the madranite mining belts in the star system of orion beta 

between them would be placed a bottle of janx spirit (as immortalized
in that ancient orion mining song oh dont give me none more of that old
janx spirit/ no, dont you give me none more of that old janx spirit/ for
my head will y, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and i may die/ wont
you pour me one more of that sinful old janx spirit) 

the bottle would then be relled 

once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of

the eects of janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power 

as soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the nal loser

would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological 

ford prefect usually played to lose  ? he asked plaintively 
ford looked across to mr  and he cant because youre lying in front of the bulldozers?
yes, and   
im sure we can come to some arrangement, said ford 

mr  prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers
about whether or not arthur dent constituted a mental health hazard, and
how much they should get paid if he did) looked around  he was surprised
and slightly alarmed to nd that arthur had company  has mr  dent come to his senses yet?
can we for the moment, called ford, assume that he hasnt?
well? sighed mr 
and can we also assume, said ford, that hes going to be staying here

all day?
so?
so all your men are going to be standing around all day doing nothing?
could be, could be   
well, if youre resigned to doing that anyway, you dont actually need

him to lie here all the time do you?

what?
you dont, said ford patiently, actually need him here 
mr  he thought that one of them wasnt making a lot

of sense 

ford said, so if you would just like to take it as read that hes actually
here, then he and i could slip o down to the pub for half an hour  how does
that sound?

mr  prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty 

thank you very much, said mr  prosser who no longer knew how to
play this at all, thank you very much, yes, thats very kind    he frowned,
then smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped hold of his fur hat
and rolled it tfully round the top of his head  

what? said mr ah, im sorry, said ford, perhaps i hadnt made myself fully clear 
somebodys got to lie in front of the bulldozers havent they? or there wont
be anything to stop them driving into mr  dents house will there?

what? said mr 
its very simple, said ford, my client, mr 

you want me, said mr 
instead of mr 
as soon as mr 

in return for which you will take mr  dent with you down to the pub?
thats it, said ford  thats it exactly 
mr 
and no sneaky knocking down mr  dents house whilst hes away, al-

right? he said 

the mere thought, growled mr  prosser, hadnt even begun to spec-
ulate, he continued, settling himself back, about the merest possibility of
crossing my mind 

he saw the bulldozer drivers union representative approaching and let his
head sink back and closed his eyes 
in a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty khan bellowed
with rage, but mr  prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered  bureaucratic cock-ups, angry
men lying in the mud, indecipherable strangers handing out inexplicable
humiliations and an unidentied army of horsemen laughing at him in his
head  what a day  ford prefect knew that it didnt matter a pair of dingos

kidneys whether arthurs house got knocked down or not now 
myself id trust him to the end of the earth, said ford 
oh yes, said arthur, and how fars that?
about twelve minutes away, said ford, come on, i need a drink 

heres what the encyclopedia galactica has to say about alcohol  it says that
alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and
also notes its intoxicating eect on certain carbon-based life forms 

the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy also mentions alcohol  it says that

the best drink in existence is the pan galactic gargle blaster 

it says that the eect of a pan galactic gargle blaster is like having your

brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick 

the guide also tells you on which planets the best pan galactic gar-
gle blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one and what
voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards 
take the juice from one bottle of that ol janx spirit, it says 
pour into it one measure of water from the seas of santraginus v  oh

that santraginean sea water, it says  oh, those santraginean sh!

allow three cubes of arcturan mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must

be properly iced or the benzine is lost) 

allow four litres of fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of

all those happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the marshes of fallia 

over the back of a silver spoon oat a measure of qualactin hypermint
extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark qualactin zones, subtle
sweet and mystic 

drop in the tooth of an algolian suntiger  watch it dissolve, spreading

the res of the algolian suns deep into the heart of the drink 

sprinkle zamphuor 
the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy sells rather better than the ency-

clopedia galactica 

six pints of bitter, said ford prefect to the barman of the horse and

groom the barman of the horse and groom didnt deserve this sort of treatment,
he was a dignied old man  he pushed his glasses up his nose and blinked at
ford prefect  ford ignored him and stared out of the window, so the barman
looked instead at arthur who shrugged helplessly and said nothing 

so the barman said, oh yes sir? nice weather for it, and started pulling

pints 
whats that, foregone conclusion then you reckon sir? said the barman 
the barman breathed in heavily 
arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again  he turned and smiled
wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them had heard what was
going on 

get o, said ford, theyre ours, giving him a look that would have

an algolian suntiger get on with what it was doing 
youve got ten minutes left to spend it 
the barman simply decided to walk away for a bit 
ford, said arthur, would you please tell me what the hell is going

on?

drink up, said ford, youve got three pints to get through 

theyve got a page for people like you 
why three pints all of a sudden?muscle relaxant, youll need it 
muscle relaxant?
muscle relaxant 
did i do anything wrong today, he said, or has the world always been

like this and ive been too wrapped up in myself to notice?

all right, said ford, ill try to explain  er, about ve years, maybe six, he said  how would you react if i said that im not from
guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of
betelgeuse?

arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way 
i dont know, he said, taking a pull of beer  why  do you think its

the sort of thing youre likely to say?

ford gave up  it really wasnt worth bothering at the moment, what with

the world being about to end 

this must be thursday, said arthur musing to himself, sinking low over

his beer, i never could get the hang of thursdays 

on this particular thursday, something was moving quietly through the iono-
sphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact,
several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike somethings, huge as oce build-
ings, silent as birds  they soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays
from the star sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing  the huge yellow
somethings went unnoticed at goonhilly, they passed over cape canaveral
without a blip, woomera and jodrell bank looked straight through them 
which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing theyd been looking
for all these years  it nestled in the
darkness inside a leather satchel which ford prefect wore habitually round
his neck  the contents of ford prefects satchel were quite interesting in fact
and would have made any earth physicists eyes pop out of his head, which
is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts
for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stued in the top  besides
the sub-etha sens-o-matic and the scripts he had an electronic thumb 
a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with a couple of at switches
and dials at one end; he also had a device which looked rather like a largish
electronic calculator  it looked insanely complicated, and this
was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it tted into had the words
dont panic printed on it in large friendly letters  the other reason was
that this device was in fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come
out of the great publishing corporations of ursa minor  the hitchhikers
guide to the galaxy  the reason why it was published in the form of a micro
sub meson electronic component is that if it were printed in normal bookform, an interstellar hitchhiker would require several inconveniently large
buildings to carry it around in 

beneath that in ford prefects satchel were a few biros, a notepad, and

a largish bath towel from marks and spencer 

the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy has a few things to say on the

subject of towels 

a towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar
hitchhiker can have  partly it has great practical value  you can wrap it
around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of jaglan beta;
you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of santraginus v, in-
haling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which
shine so redly on the desert world of kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft
down the slow heavy river moth; wet it for use in hand-tohand-combat; wrap
it round your head to ward o noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the
ravenous bugblatter beast of traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it as-
sumes that if you cant see it, it cant see you  daft as a bush, but very
ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and
of course dry yourself o with it if it still seems to be clean enough  for some
reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his
towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of
a toothbrush, face annel, soap, tin of biscuits, ask, compass, map, ball of
string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc , etc  furthermore, the
strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items
that the hitchhiker might accidentally have lost  what the strag will think
is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it,
slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his
towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with 

hence a phrase which has passed into hitchhiking slang, as in hey, you
sass that hoopy ford prefect? theres a frood who really knows where his
towel is  (sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really to-
gether guy; frood: really amazingly together guy )

nestling quietly on top of the towel in ford prefects satchel, the sub-
etha sens-o-matic began to wink more quickly  miles above the surface of
the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out  at jodrell bank,
someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea 

you got a towel with you? said ford prefect suddenly to arthur  should i have? he had given up being surprised,

there didnt seem to be any point any longer 
at that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside ltered
through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the jukebox,
through the sound of the man next to ford hiccupping over the whisky ford
had eventually bought him 
whats that? he yelped 
dont worry, said ford, they havent started yet 

my god they are! theyre knocking my house down  what the hell am

i doing in the pub, ford?

it hardly makes any dierence at this stage, said ford, let them have

their fun  turning quickly to the barman he asked

for four packets of peanuts 

there you are sir, said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar,

twenty-eight pence if youd be so kind 

ford was very kind  he gave the barman another ve-pound note and
told him to keep the change  the barman looked at it and then looked at
ford  he suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation that he
didnt understand because no one on earth had ever experienced it before  in
moments of great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny sublimal
signal  this signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense
of how far that being is from the place of his birth  on earth it is never
possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace,
which really isnt very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed  ford
prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born 600 light
years away in the near vicinity of betelgeuse the barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible
sense of distance  he didnt know what it meant, but he looked at ford
prefect with a new sense of respect, almost awe 

are you serious, sir? he said in a small whisper which had the eect of

silencing the pub  he was at his ippest 
the barman couldnt believe the conversation he was having, but he

couldnt believe the sensation he had just had either 

isnt there anything we can do about it then? he said 

the man sitting next to ford was a bit sozzled by now 
thats what they told us in the army, said the man, and his eyes began

the long trek back down to his whisky 

will that help? asked the barman  excuse me, he said,

ive got to go  the girl he had dragged along
to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour or
so, and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that
in a minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whi of
hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide  however, when the moment came
she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it 

the barman cleared his throat  this wasnt the way he had wanted it  he didnt
notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didnt notice the wind, he didntnotice the sudden irrational squall of rain  he didnt notice anything but the
caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home  until youve had enough  and when ive nished i will

take all the little bits, and i will jump on them!

arthur didnt notice that the men were running from the bulldozers; he
didnt notice that mr  prosser was staring hectically into the sky  what
mr  prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming
through the clouds  impossibly huge yellow somethings  his nger shot upwards 
its dicult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet
were doing now, because they didnt really know what they were doing them-
selves  none of it made a lot of sense running into houses, running out of
houses, howling noiselessly at the noise  all around the world city streets
exploded with people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them
and then rolled o like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans,
seeming to atten everything it hit 

only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in
his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears  he knew exactly what was happening
and had known ever since his sub-etha sens-omatic had started winking in
the dead of night beside his pillar and woken him with a start  it was what
he had waited for all these years, but when he had deciphered the signal
pattern sitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him and
squeezed his heart  of all the races in all of the galaxy who could have come
and said a big hello to planet earth, he thought, didnt it just have to be the
vogons  as the vogon craft screamed through the
air high above him he opened his satchel  he threw away a copy of joseph andthe amazing technicolor dreamcoat, he threw away a copy of godspell : he
wouldnt need them where he was going  the ships hung in the sky in much the same
way that bricks dont 
then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open am-
bient sound  every hi  set in the world, every radio, every television, every
cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every mid-range driver in the
world quietly turned itself on 

every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine glass,
every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sound-
ing board 

people of earth, your attention please, a voice said, and it was won-
derful  wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low
as to make a brave man weep 

this is prostetnic vogon jeltz of the galactic hyperspace planning coun-
cil, the voice continued  as you will no doubt be aware, the plans for de-
velopment of the outlying regions of the galaxy require the building of a hy-
perspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet
is one of those scheduled for demolition 
uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of earth  the
terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron llings
on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them  panic sprouted
again, desperate eeing panic, but there was nowhere to ee to 

observing this, the vogons turned on their pa again  it said:
theres no point in acting all surprised about it  all the planning charts
and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning departmenton alpha centauri for fty of your earth years, so youve had plenty of time
to lodge any formal complaint and its far too late to start making a fuss
about it now 

by this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter,
located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back to the vogon ships,
to plead on behalf of the planet  it said:

what do you mean youve never been to alpha centauri? for heavens
sake mankind, its only four light years away you know  im sorry, but if you
cant be bothered to take an interest in local aairs thats your own lookout 

energize the demolition beams 
light poured out into the hatchways 
i dont know, said the voice on the pa, apathetic bloody planet, ive

no sympathy at all 
the vogon constructor eet coasted away into the inky starry void 

far away on the opposite spiral arm of the galaxy, ve hundred thousand
light years from the star sol, zaphod beeblebrox, president of the imperial
galactic government, sped across the seas of damogran, his ion drive delta
boat winking and ashing in the damogran sun 

damogran the hot; damogran the remote; damogran the almost totally

unheard of 

it would be some time before it
reached its destination because damogran is such an inconveniently arranged
planet  it consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands separated
by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean 
because of this topological awkwardness damogran has always remained
a deserted planet  this is why the imperial galactic government chose
damogran for the heart of gold project, because it was so deserted and the
heart of gold was so secret 
zaphod beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on easter island
(the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence  in galacticspeke, easter
means small at and light brown) to the heart of gold island, which by
another meaningless coincidence was called france 

one of the side eects of work on the heart of gold was a whole string

of pretty meaningless coincidences 

but it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmi-
nation of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the heart of
gold was nally to be introduced to a marvelling galaxy, was also a great
day of culmination for zaphod beeblebrox  it was for the sake of this day
that he had rst decided to run for the presidency, a decision which had
sent waves of astonishment throughout the imperial galaxy  zaphod bee-blebrox? president? not the zaphod beeblebrox? not the president? many
had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole of known creation had nally
gone bananas 

zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed 
zaphod beeblebrox, adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook? quite
possibly), manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often
thought to be completely out to lunch 
only six people in the entire galaxy understood the principle on which
the galaxy was governed, and they knew that once zaphod beeblebrox had
announced his intention to run as president it was more or less a fait accompli:
he was the ideal presidency fodder 1

what they completely failed to understand was why zaphod was doing

it 
today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what
zaphod had been up to  today was what zaphod beeblebroxs presidency
was all about 

as he skipped his boat across the seas of damogran he smiled quietly to
himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be  in the last moments of his dying coma
he was locked in a statis eld which keeps him in a state of perpetual unchangingness  all
his heirs are now long dead, and this means that without any drastic political upheaval,
power has simply and eectively moved a rung or two down the ladder, and is now seen
to be vested in a body which used to act simply as advisers to the emperor  an elected
governmental assembly headed by a president elected by that assembly 

the president in particular is very much a gurehead  he wields no real power what-
soever  he is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities he is required to
display are not those of leadership but those of nely judged outrage  for this reason the
president is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating charac-
ter  on those criteria
zaphod beeblebrox is one of the most successful presidents the galaxy has ever had 
he has already spent two of his ten presidential years in prison for fraud  they couldnt be more wrong extra arm hed recently tted just beneath his right one to help improve his
ski-boxing 

hey, he cooed to himself, youre a real cool boy you  but his nerves

sang a song shriller than a dog whistle 

the island of france was about twenty miles long, ve miles across the
middle, sandy and crescent shaped  in fact it seemed to exist not so much as
an island in its own right as simply a means of dening the sweep and curve
of a huge bay  this impression was heightened by the fact that the inner
coastline of the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep clis  from the
top of the cli the land sloped slowly down ve miles to the opposite shore 

on top of the clis stood a reception committee 
it consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built
the heart of gold  mostly humanoid, but here and there were a few reptiloid
atomineers, two or three green slyph-like maximegalacticans, an octopoid
physucturalist or two and a hooloovoo (a hooloovoo is a super-intelligent
shade of the color blue)  all except the hooloovoo were resplendent in their
multicolored ceremonial lab coats; the hooloovoo had been temporarily re-
fracted into a free standing prism for the occasion 
together and between them they had gone to and beyond the furthest limits
of physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter, strained,
twisted and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the
greatest excitement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash
round his neck ) it might not even have made much dierence to them if
theyd known exactly how much power the president of the galaxy actually
wielded: none at all 

zaphod beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job  it ashed and shone as
it came skating over the sea in wide skidding turns 

in fact it didnt need to touch the water at all, because it was supported
on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms  but just for eect it was tted with
thin nblades which could be lowered into the water  they slashed sheets
of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed
crazily and sank back foaming into the boats wake as it careered across the
bay 

zaphod loved eect: it was what he was best at 
he twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scythingskid beneath the cli face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves  the three billion people werent actually there, but they
watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri-d camera
which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby  the antics of the president
always made amazingly popular tri-d; thats what they were for  three billion and six people didnt know it, but today

would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for 

the robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two
heads and he waved again  he was roughly humanoid in appearance except
for the extra head and third arm 

a twenty-foot-high transparent globe oated next to his boat, rolling and
bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun  inside it oated a wide semi-circular
sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and
rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock 
again, all done for eect as much as anything 

zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa 

water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted  up, up it
climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cli 

zaphod smiled, picturing himself 

at the top of the cli the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on to a
railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and riddled to a halt 
to tremendous applause zaphod beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble,

his orange sash blazing in the light  pages three to seven of the original version
were at the moment oating soggily on the damogran sea some ve miles out
from the bay  pages one and two had been salvaged by a damogran frondcrested eagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary
new form of nest which the eagle had invented  it was constructed largely
of papier mache and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby
eagle to break out of it  the damogran frond crested eagle had heard of
the notion of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it 

zaphod beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently

deected the one being oered him by the spider 
everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone  he singled out
trillian from the crowd  trillian was a gird that zaphod had picked up
recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito  the
arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even when they had existed
they were ve hundred thousand light years from damogran  trillian wasnt
anybody in particular, or so zaphod claimed 
she ashed him a quick tight smile and looked away  one of the
ocials of the party had irritably decided that the president was clearly not
in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for
him, and had ipped the switch on the remote control device in his pocket 

beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fty metres
long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and mindboggingly
beautiful  at the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold box which carried
within it the most brain-wretching device ever conceived, a device which
made this starship unique in the history of the galaxy, a device after which
the ship had been named  the heart of gold wow, said zaphod beeblebrox to the heart of gold  there wasnt

much else he could say  he winked
at trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at him  she knew
what he was about to say and thought him a terrible showo  that is

so amazingly amazing i think id like to steal it 

a marvellous presidential quote, absolutely true to form  the crowd
laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their sub-
etha news-matics and the president grinned 

as he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he ngered the small

paralyso-matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket 

prostetnic vogon jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other vogons  his
highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead  his dark green
rubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of vogon civil
service politics, and play it well, and waterproof enough for him to survive
indenitely at sea depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill eects  he was the way he was because billions of years ago when the
vogons had rst crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of vogsphere, and
had lain panting and heaving on the planets virgin shores  when the rst
rays of the bright young vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it
was as if the forces of evolution ad simply given up on them there and then,
had turned aside in disgust and written them o as an ugly and unfortunate
mistake 

the fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thickwilled slug-
brained stubbornness of these creatures  evolution? they said to themselves,
who needs it?, and what nature refused to do for them they simply did
without until such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical
inconveniences with surgery 

meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet vogsphere had been working
overtime to make up for their earlier blunder  they brought forth scintillating
jewelled scuttling crabs, which the vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron
mallets; tall aspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which
the vogons cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazellelike
creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the vogons would catch
and sit on  they were no use as transport because their backs would snap
instantly, but the vogons sat on them anyway 

thus the planet vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the
vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel  within a few
short vog years every last vogon had migrated to the megabrantis cluster, the
political hub of the galaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backboneof the galactic civil service  they have attempted to acquire learning, they
have attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the
modern vogon is little dierent from his primitive forebears  every year they
import twenty-seven thousand scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their
native planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits
with iron mallets 

prostetnic vogon jeltz was a fairly typical vogon in that he was thor-

oughly vile  also, he did not like hitchhikers 

* * *

somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of prostet-
nic vogon jeltzs agship, a small match ared nervously  his name was ford prefect 1

he looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous
shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny ickering ame, but all was quiet 
he breathed a silent thank you to the dentrassis  the dentrassis are an
unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the vogons had
recently taken to employing as catering sta on their long haul eets, on the
strict understanding that they keep themselves very much to themselves 

this suited the dentrassis ne, because they loved vogon money, which
is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the vogons themselves 
the only sort of vogon a dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed vogon 

it was because of this tiny piece of information that ford prefect was not

now a whi of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide  by the light of the match he saw a heavy shape
moving slightly on the oor  quickly he shook the match out, reached in his

1ford prefects original name is only pronuncible in an obscure betelgeusian dialect,
now virtually extinct since the great collapsing hrung disaster of gal /year 03758
which wiped out all the old praxibetel communities on betelgeuse seven  fords father
was the only man on the entire planet to survive the great collapsing hrung disaster, by
an extraordinary coincidence that he was never able satisfactorily to explain  the whole
episode is shrouded in deep mystery: in fact no one ever knew what a hrung was nor why
it had chosen to collapse on betelgeuse seven particularly  fords father, magnanimously
waving aside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came to live
on betelgeuse five where he both fathered and uncled ford; in memory of his now dead
race he christened him in the ancient praxibetel tongue  the other kids at school
nicknamed him ix, which in the language of betelgeuse five translates as boy who is not
able satisfactorily to explain what a hrung is, nor why it should choose to collapse on
betelgeuse seven  he crouched on the
oor 

ford prefect said: i bought some peanuts 
here, have some, urged ford, shaking the packet again, if youve never
been through a matter transference beam before youve probably lost some
salt and protein  the beer you had should have cushioned your system a
bit 

whhhrrrr 
one of the things ford prefect had always found hardest to understand
about human beings was their habit of continually stating and repeating the
obvious, as in its a nice day, or youre very tall, or oh dear you seem to
have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you alright? at rst ford had formed
a theory to account for this strange behaviour  if human beings dont keep
exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up  if they dont keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their
brains start working  after a while he abandoned this one as well as being
obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all, but
he always remained desperately worried about the terrible number of things
they didnt know about 
ford stared at him blankly in the darkness 
were in a small galley cabin, said ford, in one of the spaceships of

the vogon constructor fleet 

ah, said arthur, this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe

that i wasnt previously aware of  mon-
strous shadows leaped and loomed again  hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about
him, the air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without
identifying themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing  i can take you as far as the basingstoke roundabout?
well, said ford, the thumbs an electronic sub-etha signalling device,
the roundabouts at barnards star six light years away, but otherwise, thats
more or less right 
good grief, said arthur, is this really the interior of a ying saucer?

prostetnic vogon jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the con-
trol bridge  he always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated
planets  he opped as heavily
as he could on to his control seat in the hope that it would break and give
him something to be genuinely angry about, but it only gave a complaining
sort of creak 

go away! he shouted at a young vogon guard who entered the bridge
at that moment 
he was glad it wouldnt now be him who delivered the report theyd just
received  the report was an ocial release which said that a wonderful new
form of spaceship drive was at this moment being unveiled at a government
research base on damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial
express routes unnecessary 

another door slid open, but this time the vogon captain didnt shout be-
cause it was the door from the galley quarters where the dentrassis prepared
his meals 

a huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray 

prostetnic vogon jeltz was delighted  he knew that when a dentrassi
looked that pleased with itself there was something going on somewhere on
the ship that he could get very angry indeed about its a bit squalid, isnt it?
ford frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and unidentiable

bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the cramped cabin  these are the dentrassi

sleeping quarters 

i thought you said they were called vogons or something 
yes, said ford, the vogons run the ship, the dentrassis are the cooks,

they let us on board 

im confused, said arthur  he sat down on one of the mat-
tresses and rummaged about in his satchel  arthur prodded the mattress
nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had very little to be nervous
about, because all mattresses grown in the swamps of squornshellous zeta
are very thoroughly killed and dried before being put to service 
the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy  thats its job  dont panic  its the rst helpful or intelligible

thing anybodys said to me all day 

a screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began to icker

across the surface  his ngers

tapped some more keys 

the words vogon constructor fleets ared in green across the screen 
ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began
to undulate across it 

vogon constructor fleets  they are one of the most unpleasant races in
the galaxy  not actually evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic, ocious and
callous  they wouldnt even lift a nger to save their own grandmothers from
the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal without orders signed in triplicate,sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again,
and nally buried in soft peat and recycled as relighters 

the best way to get a drink out of a vogon is to stick your nger down
his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the
ravenous bugblatter beast of traal 

on no account allow a vogon to read poetry at you  how did we get a lift then?
thats the point, its out of date now, said ford, sliding the book back
into its cover  im doing the eld research for the new revised edition,
and one of the things ill have to include is a bit about how the vogons now
employ dentrassi cooks which gives us a rather useful little loophole 

a pained expression crossed arthurs face  theyre the best cooks and the best drink
mixers and they dont give a wet slap about anything else  and theyll
always help hitchhikers aboard, partly because they like the company, but
mostly because it annoys the vogons  which is exactly the sort of thing you
need to know if youre an impoverished hitchhiker trying to see the marvels
of the universe for less than thirty altairan dollars a day  and thats my
job  fun, isnt it?

arthur looked lost  i came for a week and got stuck for fteen years 

but how did you get there in the rst place then?
easy, i got a lift with a teaser  
a teaser? teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do  they cruise
around looking for planets which havent made interstellar contact yet and
buzz them 

buzz them? arthur began to feel that ford was enjoying making life

dicult for him  they nd some isolated spot with
very few people around, then land right by some poor soul whom no ones
ever going to believe and then strut up and down in front of him wearing
silly antennae on their heads and making beep beep noises  ford leant back on the mattress with his hands behind his head and
looked infuriatingly pleased with himself ford, insisted arthur, i dont know if this sounds like a silly question,

but what am i doing here?

well you know that, said ford  and

whats happened to the earth?
ah 
has it, said arthur levelly 
look, said arthur, im a bit upset about that 
what?
dont panic 
im not panicking!
yes you are 
all right so im panicking, what else is there to do?
you just come along with me and have a good time  the galaxys a fun

place  youll need to have this sh in your ear 
ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small
yellow sh wriggling around in it  he would
have felt safe if alongside the dentrassi underwear, the piles of squornshellous
mattresses and the man from betelgeuse holding up a small yellow sh and
oering to put it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet of
corn akes  he couldnt, and he didnt feel safe  he gasped in terror at what sounded like a man trying to gargle
whilst ghting o a pack of wolves 
im   important?
its the vogon captain making an announcement on the tannoy 
you mean thats how the vogons talk?
listen!
but i cant speak vogon!
you dont need to 
ford, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to arthurs ear, and
he had the sudden sickening sensation of the sh slithering deep into his aural
tract  gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a second or so, butthen slowly turned goggle-eyed with wonder  or of looking at a lot of coloured
dots on a piece of paper which suddenly resolve themselves into the gure
six and mean that your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a
new pair of glasses 

howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl
gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh should have a
good time  this is your captain speaking, so stop whatever
youre doing and pay attention  first of all i see from our instruments that
we have a couple of hitchhikers aboard  i worked hard to
get where i am today, and i didnt become captain of a vogon constructor
ship simply so i could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate
freeloaders  i have sent out a search party, and as soon that they nd you i
will put you o the ship  if youre very lucky i might read you some of my
poetry rst 

secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to
barnards star  ive just had an unhappy love aair, so i dont see why anybody
else should have a good time 
arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled up in
a small ball on the oor with his arms wrapped round his head  

you wouldnt need to, said ford  theyve got as much sex appeal as a
road accident  no, dont move, he added as arthur began to uncurl himself,
youd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace 

whats so unpleasant about being drunk?
you ask a glass of water yeah?
whats this sh doing in my ear?
its translating for you 

he tossed over the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and then curled

himself up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for the jump 

at that moment the bottom fell out of arthurs mind 

they were passing through hyperspace 
the babel sh, said the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy quietly, is
small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the universe 
it feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier but from those around it 
it absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to
nourish itself with  it then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic
matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve
signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied
them  the speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix
which has been fed into your mind by your babel sh 

now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-
boggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have
chosen to see it as the nal and clinching proof of the non-existence of god 

but, says man, the babel sh is a dead giveaway, isnt it? it could
not have evolved by chance  it proves you exist, and so therefore, by your
own arguments, you dont  qed 

oh dear, says god, i hadnt thought of that, and promptly vanished

in a pu of logic 

oh, that was easy, says man, and for an encore goes on to prove that

black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing 

most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingos
kidneys, but that didnt stop oolon colluphid making a small fortune when
he used it as the central theme of his bestselling book well that about wraps
it up for god 

meanwhile, the poor babel sh, by eectively removing all barriers to
communication between dierent races and cultures, has caused more andbloddier wars than anything else in the history of creation  he was horried to discover that the kick
through hyperspace hadnt killed him 
visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind  then he thought of a complete stranger he had been
standing behind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt a sudden
stab  the supermarket was gone, everything in it was gone  nelsons column
had gone! nelsons column had gone and there would be no outcry, because
there was no one left to make an outcry  from now on nelsons column only
existed in his mind  england only existed in his mind  his mind, stuck here
in this dank smelly steel-lined spaceship  hed got that  somehow hed got it  he couldnt grasp it  hed never seriously
believed it existed anyway  every bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and
that gave him a nasty knock  there is no longer
any such thing as a mcdonalds hamburger 
if youre a researcher on this book thing and you were on earth, you

must have been gathering material on it 
let me see what it says in this edition then, ive got to see it  the screen ashed and swirled and resolved
into a page of print 

it doesnt have an entry! he burst out 
yes it does, he said, down there, see at the bottom of the screen, just

under eccentrica gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of eroticon 6  for a

moment it still didnt register, then his mind nearly blew up 

well for gods sake i hope you managed to rectify that a bit 
well, said ford, if were lucky its just the vogons come to throw us

in to space 

and if were unlucky?
if were unlucky, said ford grimly, the captain might be serious in his

threat that hes going to read us some of his poetry rst   

vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the universe  the second worst
is that of the azagoths of kria  during a recitation by their poet master
grunthos the flatulent of his poem ode to a small lump of green putty i
found in my armpit one midsummer morning four of his audience died of
internal haemorrhaging, and the president of the mid-galactic arts nobbling
council survived by gnawing one of his own legs o  grunthos is reported
to have been disappointed by the poems reception, and was about to
embark on a reading of his twelvebook epic entitled my favourite bathtime
gurgles when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life
and civilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain 

prostetnic vogon jeltz smiled very slowly  this was done not so much for
eect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle move-
ments  vogons
suered no illusions as to the regard their works were generally held in  their
early attempts at composition had been part of bludgeoning insistence that
they be accepted as a properly evolved and cultured race, but now the only
thing that kept them going was sheer bloodymindedness 

the sweat stood out cold on ford prefects brow, and slid round the
electrodes strapped to his temples  these were attached to a battery of
electronic equipment  imagery intensiers, rhythmic modulators, alliterative
residulators and simile dumpers  all designed to heighten the experience of
the poem and make sure that not a single nuance of the poets thought was
lost  he had no idea what he was in for, buthe knew that he hadnt liked anything that had happened so far and didnt
think things were likely to change 

the vogon began to read  a fetid little passage of his own devising 
oh freddled gruntbuggly   spasms wracked fords body 

this was worse than ever hed been prepared for  thy micturations are to me  as plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid

bee 

groop i implore thee, continued the merciless vogon, my foonting

turlingdromes 

his voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned stridency  and
hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,/ or i will rend thee in the
gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if i dont!

nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh! cried ford prefect
and threw one nal spasm as the electronic enhancement of the last line
caught him full blast across the temples 

arthur lolled 
now earthlings    whirred the vogon (he didnt know that ford pre-
fect was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of betelgeuse, and wouldnt
have cared if he had) i present you with a simple choice! either die in the
vacuum of space, or  

the vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that eectively obscured his nose

and was therefore no bad thing 
oh yes, said arthur, i thought that some of the metaphysical imagery

was really particularly eective  were they really going to be able to bareface their
way out of this?

yes, do continue    invited the vogon  and, er   er   er    he oundered 

ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding counterpoint the surrealism of the
underlying metaphor of the   er    he oundered too, but arthur was
ready again 
ah yes, vogonity  sorry  of the poets compassionate soul,  arthur
felt he was on a home stretch now  ,which contrives through the medium of
the verse structure to sublimate this, transcend that, and come to terms with
the fundamental dichotomies of the other,  he was reaching a triumphant
crescendo  and one is left with a profound and vivid insight into   er  

the vogon perused them  his voice took on the
quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon 

so what youre saying is that i write poetry because underneath my
mean callous heartless exterior i really just want to be loved, he said  well i mean yes, he said, dont we all,

deep down, you know   er   

the vogon stood up 
no, well youre completely wrong, he said, i just write poetry to throw
my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief  im going to throw you
o the ship anyway 
a huge young vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their

straps with his huge blubbery arms 

resistance is useless! shouted the vogon guard back at him  it was the

rst phrase hed learnt when he joined the vogon guard corps 
i dont want to die now! he yelled  ive still got a headache! i dont
want to go to heaven with a headache, id be all cross and wouldnt enjoy
it!the guard grasped them both rmly round the neck, and bowing defer-
entially towards his captains back, hoiked them both protesting out of the
bridge  he hummed
quietly and mused to himself, lightly ngering his notebook of verses 

the long steel-lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of the two

humanoids clamped rmly under rubbery vogon armpits 

this is great, spluttered arthur, this is really terric  let go of me

you brute!

the vogon guard dragged them on 
dont you worry, said ford, ill think of something  he didnt sound

hopeful 
just dont say things like that, stammered ford  how can anyone

maintain a positive mental attitude if youre saying things like that?

my god, complained arthur, youre talking about a positive mental
attitude and you havent even had your planet demolished today  i woke up
this morning and thought id have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading,
brush the dog   its now just after four in the afternoon and im already
thrown out of an alien spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of
the earth! he spluttered and gurgled as the vogon tightened his grip 

all right, said ford, just stop panicking  you wait till ive settled down into the situation and
found my bearings  then ill start panicking 

arthur youre getting hysterical 
the vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped slowly

over his face  what do you mean?what i mean, said ford, is does it give you a full satisfying life?

stomping around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships   

the vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost
rolled over each other  his mouth slacked  

theyd have to be, agreed ford 

the vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the

murky depths  he lled
his lungs and bellowed, resistance is   

sure, yes, interrupted ford hurriedly, youre good at that, i can tell 
but if its mostly lousy, he said, slowly giving the words time to reach their
mark, then why do you do it? what is it? the girls? the leather? the
machismo? or do you just nd that coming to terms with the mindless
tedium of it all presents an interesting challenge?

arthur looked backward and forward between them in baement 
er    said the guard, er   er   i dunno  my aunt said that spaceship guard was a good career for a young
vogon  you know, the uniform, the lowslung stun ray holster, the mindless
tedium   

there you are, arthur, said ford with the air of someone reaching the

conclusion of his argument, you think youve got problems  apart from the unpleasant business with
his home planet the vogon guard had half-throttled him already and he
didnt like the sound of being thrown into space very much  here he is poor lad,
his entire lifes work is stamping around, throwing people o spaceships  
and shouting, sure, said ford patting the blubbery arm clamped round
his neck in friendly condescension,   and he doesnt even know why hes
doing it!

arthur agreed this was very sad  he did this with a small feeble gesture,

because he was too asphyxicated to speak 

deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard 
but alright, went on the rumblings, so whats the alternative?
well, said ford, brightly but slowly, stop doing it of course! tell
them, he went on, youre not going to do it anymore 

eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    said the guard, erm,

well that doesnt sound that great to me 
now wait a minute, he said, thats just the start you see, theres more

to it than that you see   

but at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his orig-
inal purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock 

no, i think if its all the same to you, he said, id better get you
both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of
shouting ive got to do 

it wasnt all the same to ford prefect after all 
huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn    said arthur without any clear inection 
but hang on, pursued ford, theres music and art and things to tell

you about yet! arrrggghhh!

resistance is useless, bellowed the guard, and then added, you see
if i keep it up i can eventually get promoted to senior shouting ocer,
and there arent usually many vacancies for non-shouting and non-pushing-
people-about ocers, so i think id better stick to what i know 

but thanks for taking an interest, said the vogon guard  he
ung ford and arthur through the hatchway into the small chamber within  ford scrambled round and ung his shoulder
uselessly against the reclosing hatchway 

but listen, he shouted to the guard, theres a whole world you dont
know anything about   here how about this? desperately he grabbed
for the only bit of culture he knew ohand  he hummed the rst bar of
beethovens fifth 

da da da dum! doesnt that stir anything in you?
no, said the guard, not really  the hatchway sealed
itself tight, and all sound was lost but the faint distant hum of the shipsengines 

arthur was still lying in the curve of the oor where he had fallen  he

didnt look up 
were trapped now arent we?
yes, said ford, were trapped 
well didnt you think of anything? i thought you said you were going to

think of something  perhaps you thought of something and didnt notice 
but unfortunately, continued ford, it rather involved being on the
other side of this airtight hatchway  he kicked the hatch theyd just been
through 
what was it?
well i hadnt worked out the details yet  er, what happens next?
oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in a few
moments and we will shoot out into deep space i expect and asphyxicate 
if you take a lungful of air with you you can last for up to thirty seconds
of course   he stuck his hands behind his back, raised his
eyebrows and started to hum an old betelgeusian battle hymn  to arthurs
eyes he suddenly looked very alien  no! wait a minute!
he suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind arthurs

line of vision  whats this switch? he cried 

you know, said arthur, its at times like this, when im trapped in a
vogon airlock with a man from betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxication
in deep space that i really wish id listened to what my mother told me when
i was young 

why, what did she tell you?i dont know, i didnt listen 
this is terric, arthur thought to himself, nelsons column has gone,
mcdonalds have gone, all thats left is me and the words mostly harmless 

a motor whirred 
a slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the outer hatch-
way opened on to an empty blackness studded with tiny impossibly bright
points of light 

the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a wholly remarkable book  it has
been compiled and recompiled many times over many years and under many
dierent editorships  you just wont believe how vastly
hugely mindboggingly big it is  i mean you may think its a long way down
the road to the chemist, but thats just peanuts to space 

(after a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things
you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet beth-
selamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visit-
ing tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and
the amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your
bodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory it is vitally
important to get a receipt )

to be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of distances
between the stars, better minds than the one responsible for the guides in-
troduction have faltered  some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut
in reading and a small walnut in johannesburg, and other such dizzying con-
cepts 
it takes eight minutes from the star sol to the place where the earth used to
be, and four years more to arrive at sols nearest stellar neighbour, alpha
proxima 

for light to reach the other side of the galaxy, for it to reach damogran

for instance, takes rather longer: ve hundred thousand years the record for hitch hiking this distance is just under ve years, but you

dont get to see much on the way 

the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of
air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds 
however it goes on to say that what with space being the mind boggling size it
is the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds
are two to the power of two hundred and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred
and nine to one against 

by a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of
an islington at where arthur once went to a very good party and met a
very nice girl whom he totally failed to get o with  she went o with a
gatecrasher 

though the planet earth, the islington at and the telephone have all
now been demolished, it is comforting to reect that they are all in some
small way commemorated by the fact that twenty-nine seconds later ford and
arthur were rescued 
it was exactly a nothingth of a second long, a
nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of million light years from end to
end 

two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too,
materializing in a large woobly heap on the faminestruck land of poghril in
the pansel system 

the whole poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man

who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later 

the nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated back-
wards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion  somewhere
in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small random group of
atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling to-
gether in the most extraordinarily unlikely patterns  these patterns quickly
learnt to copy themselves (this was part of what was so extraordinary of the
patterns) and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted
on to 

five wild event maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason and

spewed up a pavement 

on the pavement lay ford prefect and arthur dent gulping like half-spent

sh 

there you are, gasped ford, scrabbling for a ngerhold on the pavement
as it raced through the third reach of the unknown, i told you id think
of something bright idea of mine, said ford, to nd a passing spaceship and get

rescued by it 

the real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them  various pretend
ones itted silently by, like mountain goats  primal light exploded, splatter-
ing space-time as with gobbets of junket 
dont knock it, it worked, said ford 
what sort of ship are we in? asked arthur as the pit of eternity yawned

beneath them 

i dont know, said ford, i havent opened my eyes yet 
the universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several unex-

pected directions 

arthur and ford opened their eyes and looked about in considerable sur-

prise 

good god, said arthur, it looks just like the sea front at southend 
hell, im relieved to hear you say that, said ford 
well, did you say it or didnt you? he asked 
yes, said arthur, wed be mad, all things considered, to think this was

southend  who was that? asked arthur who 

the man with the ve heads and the elderberry bush full of kippers?

yes, said a passing maniac 
who  the man with the ve heads and the elderberry bush full of

kippers?
yes 
i dont know 
they both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease as
huge children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses thundered
through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings to the uncertain
areas 

you know, said arthur with a slight cough, if this is southend, theres

something very odd about it   in fact, he con-
tinued as with a huge bang southend split itself into six equal segments which
danced and span giddily round each other in lewd and licentious formation,
there is something altogether very strange going on 

wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind, hot
doughnuts popped out of the road for ten pence each, horrid sh stormed
out of the sky and arthur and ford decided to make a run for it 

they plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic thought,
valleys of mood music, bad shoe sessions and footling bats and suddenly heard
a girls voice 

ford skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to nd a source

for the voice but could see nothing he could seriously believe in 
i dont know, yelled ford, i dont know  you know, like two to one, three to one, ve to four against  thats
pretty improbable you know 

a million-gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without warning 
what, the custard?
no, the measurement of probability!
i dont know  i dont know at all 

i can only assume, said arthur, that this is not the rstclass compart-

ment 

bulges appeared in the fabric of space-time  great ugly bulges 
haaaauuurrgghhh   southend seems to be melting away   a dustbowl  

ford, he said, youre turning into a penguin 
ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle  where are you? whats going on and

is there any way of stopping it?

please relax, said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an airliner
with only one wing and two engines one of which is on re, you are perfectly
safe 

but thats not the point! raged ford  the point is that i am now
a perfectly save penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out of
limbs!

its alright, ive got them back now, said arthur 
two to the power of fty thousand to one against and falling, said the

voice 

admittedly, said arthur, theyre longer than i usually like them, but

  

isnt there anything, squawked ford in avian fury, you feel you ought

to be telling us?

the voice cleared its throat  a giant petit four lolloped o into the

distance 

welcome, the voice said, to the starship heart of gold  you are bound to feel some initial ill eects as you have been rescued
from certain death at an improbability level of two to the power of two
hundred and seventy-six thousand to one against  possibly much higher 
we are now cruising at a level of two to the power of twenty-ve thousand
to one against and falling, and we will be restoring normality just as soon as
we are sure what is normal anyway 
ford and arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle 
arthur! he said, this is fantastic! weve been picked up by a ship
powered by the innite improbability drive! this is incredible!
i heard
rumors about it before! they were all ocially denied, but they must havedone it! theyve built the improbability drive! arthur, this is   arthur?
whats happening?

arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle, trying to hold
it closed, but it was ill tting  tiny furry little hands were squeezing them-
selves through the cracks, their ngers were inkstained; tiny voices chattered
insanely 
ford! he said, theres an innite number of monkeys outside who want

to talk to us about this script for hamlet theyve worked out 

the innite improbability drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast
interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious
mucking about in hyperspace 

it was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a governable
form of propulsion by the galactic governments research team on damo-
gran 
the principle of generating small amounts of nite improbability by sim-
ply hooking the logic circuits of a bambleweeny 57 submeson brain to an
atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong brownian motion producer (say
a nice hot cup of tea) were of course well understood  and such genera-
tors were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules
in the hostesss undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in
accordance with the theory of indeterminacy 

many respectable physicists said that they werent going to stand for this
 partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they
didnt get invited to those sort of parties 

another thing they couldnt stand was the perpetual failure they en-
countered in trying to construct a machine which could generate the innite
improbability eld needed to ip a spaceship across the mind-paralysing dis-
tances between the furthest stars, and in the end they grumpily announced
that such a machine was virtually impossible 

then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a

particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way:

if, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then
it must logically be a nite improbability  so all i have to do in order to
make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed that gure into
the nite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea   and
turn it on!

he did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed tocreate the long sought after golden innite improbability generator out of
thin air 

it startled him even more when just after he was awarded the galactic
institutes prize for extreme cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob
of respectable physicists who had nally realized that the one thing they
really couldnt stand was a smartass  some of the control seats hadnt had the plastic wrapping
taken o yet  in fact it wasnt perfectly oblong: the two long walls
were raked round in a slight parallel curve, and all the angles and corners
were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes  as it was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful, with
large video screens ranged over the control and guidance system panels on
the concave wall, and long banks of computers set into the convex wall  it too was fairly new, but
though it was beautifully constructed and polished it somehow looked as if
the various parts of its more or less humanoid body didnt quite t properly 
in fact they tted perfectly well, but something in its bearing suggested that
they might have tted better 

zaphod beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, brushing his

hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling with excitement 

trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading o gures  her

voice was carried round the tannoy system of the whole ship  we
have normality, i repeat we have normality 

zaphod burst out in annoyance: who are they trillian?
trillian span her seat round to face him and shrugged  section zz9 plural z alpha 

yeah, well thats a very sweet thought trillian, complained zaphod,
but do you really think its wise under the circumstances? i mean, here we
are on the run and everything, we must have the police of half the galaxy
after us by now, and we stop to pick up hitchhikers  trillian quietly moved his hand
before he tapped anything important  whatever zaphods qualities of mind
might include  dash, bravado, conceit  he was mechanically inept and could
easily blow the ship up with an extravagant gesture  trillian had come to
suspect that the main reason why he had had such a wild and successful life
that he never really understood the signicance of anything he did 

zaphod, she said patiently, they were oating unprotected in open

space   you wouldnt want them to have died would you?

well, you know   
not as such? not die as such? but? trillian cocked her head on one

side 
yeah, so if youd taken the trouble to think about the problem a bit

longer it would have gone away 

youd been happy to let them die?
well, you know, not happy as such, but   
anyway, said trillian, turning back to the controls, i didnt pick them

up 
huh?
while we were in improbability drive 
but thats incredible 
no zaphod 
look zaphod, she said, patting his arm, dont worry about the aliens 
theyre just a couple of guys i expect  it pulled itself up to its feet as if it was about ve pounds
heavier that it actually was, and made what an outside observer would havethought was a heroic eort to cross the room  it stopped in front of trillian
and seemed to stare through her left shoulder 

i think you ought to know im feeling very depressed, it said 

oh god, muttered zaphod and slumped into a seat 
well, said trillian in a bright compassionate tone, heres something

to occupy you and keep your mind o things 

it wont work, droned marvin, i have an exceptionally large mind 
marvin! warned trillian 

with a microsecond pause, and a nely calculated micromodulation of
pitch and timbre  nothing you could actually take oence at  marvin
managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all things human 
yes, said trillian rmly 
zaphod leaped out of his seat 
shes not asking you to enjoy it, he shouted, just do it will you?
all right, said marvin like the tolling of a great cracked bell, ill do

it 

im not getting you down at all am i? he said pathetically 
no no marvin, lilted trillian, thats just ne, really   
i wouldnt like to think that i was getting you down 
no, dont worry about that, the lilt continued, you just act as comes

naturally and everything will be just ne 

youre sure you dont mind? probed marvin 
no no marvin, lilted trillian, thats just ne, really  

marvin ashed him an electronic look 
life, said marvin, dont talk to me about life 

with a satised hum and a click the door closed behind him

i dont think i can stand that robot much longer zaphod, growled

trillian 

the encyclopaedia galactica denes a robot as a mechanical apparatus
designed to do the work of a man  the marketing division of the siriuscybernetics corporation denes a robot as your plastic pal whos fun to
be with 

the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy denes the marketing division of
the sirius cybernetics corporation as a bunch of mindless jerks wholl be
the rst against the wall when the revolution comes, with a footnote to the
eect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in
taking over the post of robotics correspondent 

curiously enough, an edition of the encyclopaedia galactica that had
the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the
future dened the marketing division of the sirius cybernetics corporation
as a bunch of mindless jerks who were the rst against the wall when the
revolution came 

the pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had sunk away
to a better dimension  ford and arthur found themselves in the embarkation
area of the ship  have you got some exotic device for

measuring the age of metal?

no, i just found this sales brochure lying on the oor  its a lot of the

universe can be yours stu 
it says: sensational new breakthrough in improbability physics  as soon
as the ships drive reaches innite improbability it passes through every point
in the universe  wow, this is big
league stu 

ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship, occasionally
gasping with astonishment at what he read  clearly galactic astrotechnology
had moved ahead during the years of his exile 

arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand the vast
majority of what ford was saying he began to let his mind wander, trailing
his ngers along the edge of an incomprehensible computer bank, he reached
out and pressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby panel 
listen, said ford, who was still engrossed in the sales brochure, they
a new generation of sirius
make a big thing of the ships cybernetics 
cybernetics corporation robots and computers, with the new gpp feature  

gpp feature? said arthur  whats that?
oh, it says genuine people personalities  they span round and saw an abjectsteel man standing hunched in the doorway  just dont
even talk about it  the
irony circuits cut into his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of the
sales brochure 

as the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did indeed
have a satised sigh-like quality to it  hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!
it said 

marvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits chattered
with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing physical violence
against it further circuits cut in saying, why bother? whats the point?
nothing is worth getting involved in  further circuits amused themselves by
analysing the molecular components of the door, and of the humanoids brain
cells  for a quick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in
the surrounding cubic parsec of space and then shut down again in boredom 

come on, he droned, ive been ordered to take you down to the bridge  call that job satisfaction? cos i dont  i can tell

by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly generates 
the others followed quickly and the door slit back into place with pleased

little clicks and whirrs 

thank you the marketing division of the sirius cybernetics corpora-
tion, said marvin and trudged desolately up the gleaming curved corridor
that stretched out before them 
im a personality
prototype  you can tell cant you?

ford and arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers  im not getting you down at all

am i?which government  
stolen?
stolen? mimicked marvin 
zaphod beeblebrox  at least ve entirely
separate and distinct expressions of shock and amazement piled up on it in a
jumbled mess  his left leg, which was in mid stride, seemed to have diculty
in nding the oor again  he stared at the robot and tried to entangle some
dartoid muscles 

zaphod beeblebrox   pardon me for breathing, which i never do anyway so i dont
know why i bother to say it, oh god im so depressed  heres another of
those self-satised door  life! dont talk to me about life  did that robot say zaphod beeblebrox? he said 

a loud clatter of gunk music ooded through the heart of gold cabin as
zaphod searched the sub-etha radio wavebands for news of himself  the ma-
chine was rather dicult to operate  it saved a lot of
muscular expenditure of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly
still if you wanted to keep listening to the same programme 

zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again  and news brought to you here on the sub-etha wave band, broadcasting
around the galaxy around the clock, squawked a voice, and well be saying
a big hello to all intelligent life forms everywhere   and of course, the big
news story tonight is the sensational theft of the new improbability drive pro-
totype ship by none other than galactic president zaphod beeblebrox  and
the question everyones asking is   has the big z nally ipped? beeble-
brox, the man who invented the pan galactic gargle blaster, ex-condence
trickster, once described by eccentrica gallumbits as the best bang since the
big one, and recently voted the wort dressed sentinent being in the known
universe for the seventh time   has he got an answer this time? we asked
his private brain care specialist gag halfrunt   another voice broke in,
presumably halfrunt  he said: vell, zaphods jist zis guy you know? but
got no further because an electric pencil ew across the cabin and through
the radios on/o sensitive airspace  zaphod turned and glared at trillian 
she had thrown the pencil 

hey, he said, what do you do that for?trillian was tapping her ngers on a screenful of gures 
ive just thought of something, she said 
yeah? worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for?
you hear enough about yourself as it is 
im very insecure 
if theres anything more important than my ego around, i want it caught

and shot now  zaphod glared at her again, then laughed 
we picked them up in sector zz9 plural z alpha 
yeah? said zaphod and blinked  trillian said quietly, does that mean

anything to you?

mmmmm, said zaphod, zz9 plural z alpha  zz9 plural z alpha?
well? said trillian 
er   what does the z mean? said zaphod 
one of the major diculties trillian experienced in her relationship with
zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just
to get people o their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldnt be
bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to
be outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didnt understand
what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid  he proered people to be puz-
zled rather than contemptuous  this above all appeared to trillian to be
genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it 

she sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she could
make it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it to be that way  yeah! said zaphod  we should have zapped straight
into the middle of the horsehead nebula  how did we come to be there? i
mean thats nowhere 
improbability drive, she said patiently 

yeah, but thats one wild coincidence isnt it?
yes 
picking someone up at that point? out of the whole of the universe to

choose from? thats just too   computer!

the sirius cybernetics corporation shipboard computer which controlled
and permeated every particle of the ship switched into communication mode 
hi there! it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny ribbon

of ticker tape just for the record  the ticker tape said, hi there!

oh god, said zaphod  he hadnt worked with this computer for long

but had already learned to loathe it 

yeah yeah, said zaphod  

shut up! said zaphod, and snatching up a pencil sat down next to

trillian at the console 

zaphod and trillian pored over the gures that the improbability ight

path scanner ashed silently up in front of them 

can we work out, said zaphod, from their point of view what the

improbability of their rescue was?

yes, thats a constant, said trillian, two to the power of two hundred

and seventy-six thousand seven hundred and nine to one against 

thats high  theyre two lucky lucky guys  
trillian punched up the gures  they showed tow-to-the powerof-innity-
minus-one (an irrational number that only has a conventional meaning in
improbability physics) 

its pretty low, continued zaphod with a slight whistle 
yes, agreed trillian, and looked at him quizzically thats one big whack of improbability to be accounted for 

zaphod scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the pencil

away 
well?
zaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted his teeth  

improbability data, yeah  heres an interesting little notion  did

you realize that most peoples lives are governed by telephone numbers?

a pained look crawled across one of zaphods faces and on to the other

one  
trillian gasped  she scrabbled at the buttons on the improbability ight

path screen  did that thing say telephone number ?
numbers ashed up on the screen  
dont bother please, said trillian 
look, what is this? said zaphod 
i dont know, said trillian, but those aliens  theyre on the way up to
the bridge with that wretched robot  can we pick them up on any monitor
cameras?

marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning 

and then of course ive got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my

left hand side   really?
oh yes, said marvin, i mean ive asked for them to be replaced but

no one ever listens  well well well, he kept saying to himself, zaphod beeblebrox  
you know whats happened now of course?
no, what? said arthur, who didnt what to know 
weve arrived at another of those doors  do we go through?
do we go through? mimicked marvin  probably the highest demand
that will be made on my intellectual capacities today i shouldnt wonder 
deep in marvins thorax gears ground 

he heaved himself through the door and left ford and arthur staring at
each other and shrugging their shoulders  from inside they heard marvins
voice again  do you want me

to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where im standing?

yeah, just show them in would you marvin? came another voice 
whats  
arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man lolling
back in a chair with his feet on a control console picking the teeth in his right-
hand head with his left hand  the number of things that arthur couldnt believe
he was seeing was fairly large  his jaw apped about at a loose end for a
while 

the peculiar man waved a lazy wave at ford and with an appalling af-
fectation of nonchalance said, ford, hi, how are you? glad you could drop
in 

ford was not going to be outcooled 
zaphod, he drawled, great to see you, youre looking well, the extra

arm suits you  nice ship youve stolen 

arthur goggled at him 
you mean you know this guy? he said, waving a wild nger at zaphod 
know him! exclaimed ford, hes   and arthur, he said, this is my semi-cousin zaphod

beeb   

weve met, said arthur sharply 
when youre cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail
past a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself
and then accidentally change down from fourth to rst instead of third thus
making your engine leap out of your bonnet in a rather ugly mess, it tends
to throw you o your stride in much the same way that this remark threw
ford prefect o his 

er   what?
i said weve met 
zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum sharply  er   now he felt
he was back on home ground he suddenly began to resent having lumberedhimself with this ignorant primitive who knew as much about the aairs of
the galaxy as an ilford-based gnat knew about life in peking 

what do you mean youve met? he demanded  this is zaphod beeble-
brox from betelgeuse five you know, not bloody martin smith from croy-
don 

i dont care, said arthur coldly  weve met, havent we zaphod bee-

blebrox  or should i say  
youll have to remind me, said zaphod  ive a terrible memory for

species 
yeah, well i doubt that, said zaphod 
arthur would not be deterred  

zaphod shook his head with a tight-lipped smile 
london, insisted arthur, islington 
oh, said zaphod with a guilty start, that party 
this wasnt fair on ford at all  he looked backwards and forwards be-
tween arthur and zaphod  what? he said to zaphod  you dont mean
to say youve been on that miserable planet as well do you?

no, of course not, said zaphod breezily  

but i was stuck there for fteen years!
well i didnt know that, did i?
but what were you doing there?
looking about, you know 
he gatecrashed a party, persisted arthur, trembling with anger, a

fancy dress party   

it would have to be, wouldnt it? said ford  oh well, look it doesnt

matter now  

i wish youd stop sulking about that bloody planet, said ford  well all right, i wasnt doing very well with her 
id been trying all evening  beautiful,
charming, devastatingly intelligent, at last id got her to myself for a bit and
was plying her with a bit of talk when this friend of yours barges up and says
hey doll, is this guy boring you? why dont you talk to me instead? im
from a dierent planet  
but you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet, said
trillian wandering into sight at the other end of the bridge 

there was silence for a few seconds, and then out of the scrambled mess

of arthurs brain crawled some words 

tricia mcmillian? he said  after all with a degree in maths
and another in astrophysics what else was there to do? it was either that or
the dole queue again on monday 

innity minus one, chattered the computer, improbability sum now

complete 

zaphod looked about him, at ford, at arthur, and then at trillian 
trillian, he said, is this sort of thing going to happen every time we

use the improbability drive?

very probably, im afraid, she said 

the heart of gold ed on silently through the night of space, now on con-
ventional photon drive 

as the ships articial night closed in they were each grateful to retire to

separate cabins and try to rationalize their thoughts 

trillian couldnt sleep  she sat on a couch and stared at a small cage which
contained her last and only links with earth  two white mice that she had
insisted zaphod let her bring  it
seemed remote and unreal and she could nd no thoughts to think about it 
she watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running furiously in their
little plastic treadwheels till they occupied her whole attention  suddenly
she shook herself and went back to the bridge to watch over the tiny ashing
lights and gures that charted the ships progress through the void 

zaphod couldnt sleep  he also wished he knew what it was that he
wouldnt let himself think about  for as long as he could remember hed
suered from a vague nagging feeling of being not all there  most of the time
he was able to put this thought aside and not worry about it, but it had been
re-awakened by the sudden inexplicable arrival of ford prefect and arthur
dent  somehow it seemed to conform to a pattern that he couldnt see 

ford couldnt sleep  fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over, just as he was nally
beginning to give up hope  knocking about with zaphod for a bit promised
to be a lot of fun, though there seemed to be something faintly odd about his
semi-cousin that he couldnt put his nger on  the fact that he had become
president of the galaxy was frankly astonishing, as was the manner of hisleaving the post  was there a reason behind it? there would be no point in
asking zaphod, he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at
all: he had turned unfathomably into an art form  he attacked everything
in life with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it
was often dicult to tell which was which 
there was a tap at zaphods door 
zaphod   ?
yeah?
trillian stood outlined in an oval of light  he sat at it for a while and tried to
compose a new entry for the guide on the subject of vogons but couldnt
think of anything vitriolic enough so he gave that up too, wrapped a robe
round himself and went for a walk to the bridge 

as he entered he was surprised to see two gures hunched excitedly over

the instruments 

see? the ships about to move into orbit, trillian was saying  theres

a planet out there 

zaphod heard a noise and looked up  it was a series of gures ashing over a

screen 

you recognize those galactic coordinates? said zaphod  computer!
hi gang! enthused the computer  this is getting real sociable isnt

it?

shut up, said zaphod, and show up the screens  pinpoints of light played across the consoles
and reected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at the external monitor
screens 
recognize that? whispered zaphod 
recognize it?
what are you talking about?were in the horsehead nebula 
and i was meant to recognize that from a blank screen?
inside a dark nebula is the only place in the galaxy youd see a dark

screen 
zaphod laughed 

hey, this is really terric, this is just far too much!
whats so great about being stuck in a dust cloud? said ford 
what would you reckon to nd here? urged zaphod 
computer! shouted zaphod, rotate angle of vision through oneeighty

degrees and dont talk about it!

for a moment it seemed that nothing was happening, then a brightness
glowed at the edge of the huge screen  a red star the size of a small plate
crept across it followed quickly by another one  a binary system 

ive found it! cried zaphod, thumping the console  ive found it!
ford stared at it in astonishment   said zaphod, is the most improbable planet that ever ex-

isted 

(excerpt from the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, page 634784, section
5a, entry: magrathea)

far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of
the former galactic empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free  mighty
starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and reward
amongst the furthest reaches of galactic space  in those days spirits were
brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women,
and small furry creatures from alpha centauri were real small furry creatures
from alpha centauri  and all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty
deeds, to boldly split innitives that no man had split before  and thus was
the empire forged  and for all the richest and most successful merchants
life inevitably became rather dull and niggly, and they began to imagine that
this was therefore the fault of the worlds theyd settled on  none of them was
entirely satisfactory: either the climate wasnt quite right in the later part of
the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly
the wrong shade of pink  the home of this industry
was the planet magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through
white holes in space to form it into dream planets  gold planets, platinum
planets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes  all lovingly made to
meet the exacting standards that the galaxys richest men naturally came to
expect 

but so successful was this venture that magrathea itself soon became the
richest planet of all time and the rest of the galaxy was reduced to abject
poverty  and so the system broke down, the empire collapsed, and a longsullen silence settled over a billion worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratch-
ings of scholars as they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on
the value of a planned political economy 

magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the obscu-

rity of legend 

youre crazy, zaphod, he was saying, magrathea is a myth, a fairy
story, its what parents tell their kids about at night if they want them to
grow up to become economists, its   

and thats what we are currently in orbit around, insisted zaphod  

computer! shouted zaphod  
hi there! this is eddie your shipboard computer, and im feeling just
great guys, and i know im just going to get a bundle of kicks out of any
programme you care to run through me 

arthur looked inquiringly at trillian 
a real pleasure feller, it burbled; we are currently in orbit at an alti-

tude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of magrathea  i wouldnt trust that computer to speak

my weight 

i can do that for you, sure, enthused the computer, punching out more
tickertape 

trillian interrupted 

hey, what do you mean by that? the planets where i predicted it would

be isnt it?

yes, i know theres a planet there  im not arguing with anyone, its just
that i wouldnt know magrathea from any other lump of cold rock  dawnscoming up if you want it 
a dark featureless mass once more lled the screens  the planet rolling

away beneath them 

they watched for a moment in silence, but zaphod was dgety with

excitement  magrathea! he was piqued by fords sceptical
reaction  even the most seasoned star tramp cant help
but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen from space, but a binary
sunrise is one of the marvels of the galaxy  fierce shafts of colour streaked through the
thin atmosphere beneath them 

the res of dawn   ! breathed zaphod  the twin suns of soulianis

and rahm  
soulianis and rahm! insisted zaphod 
the suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music oated
through the bridge: marvin was humming ironically because he hated hu-
mans so much  it faintly irritated him that zaphod had
to impose some ludicrous fantasy on to the scene to make it work for him 
all this magrathea nonsense seemed juvenile  isnt it enough to see that a
garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the
bottom of it too?

all this magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to arthur 

he edged up to trillian and asked her what was going on i only know what zaphods told me, she whispered  apparently ma-
grathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one seriously believes
in  bit like atlantis on earth, except that the legends say the magratheans
used to manufacture planets 

arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something impor-

tant  the suns now stood high in the black sky,
the pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the surface of the planet appeared
bleak and forbidding in the common light of day  grey, dusty and only
dimly contoured  from time to time
promising features would appear on the distant horizon  ravines, maybe
mountains, maybe even cities  but as they approached the lines would soften
and blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire  
it is, said zaphod  what do you want with it anyway?

theres nothing there 

not on the surface, said zaphod 
all right, just supposing theres something  i take it youre not here for

the sheer industrial archaeology of it all  what are you after?

one of zaphods heads looked away  the other one looked round to see
what the rst was looking at, but it wasnt looking at anything very much 
well, said zaphod airily, its partly the curiosity, partly a sense of

adventure, but mostly i think its the fame and the money   he got a very strong impression that zaphod

hadnt the faintest idea why he was there at all 

you know i dont like the look of that planet at all, said trillian shiv-

ering 

ah, take no notice, said zaphod, with half the wealth of the former

galactic empire stored on it somewhere it can aord to look frumpy  even supposing this was the home of some an-
cient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of exceedinglyunlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures of wealth were going to
be stored there in any form that would still have meaning now 

the planet in question is in fact the legendary magrathea 
the deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic
defence system will result merely in the breakage of three coee cups and a
micecage, the bruising of somebodys upper arm, and the untimely creation
and sudden demise of a bowl of petunias and an innocent sperm whale  this
fact may safely be made the subject of suspense since it is of no signicance
whatsoever 

after a fairly shaky start to the day, arthurs mind was beginning to re-
assemble itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day had left
him with  he had found a nutri-matic machine which had provided him
with a plastic cup lled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely
unlike tea  when the drink
button was pressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of
the subjects taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subjects metabolism
and then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the
taste centres of the subjects brain to see what was likely to go down well  the
nutri-matic was designed and manufactured by the sirius cybernetics cor-
poration whose complaints department now covers all the major land masses
of the rst three planets in the sirius tau star system  he glanced up at the
screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren greyness slide
past 
magratheas been dead for ve million years, said zaphod, of course
its safe 
computer! shouted zaphod 
hi there!
what the photon is it?
oh, just some ve-million-year-old tape thats being broadcast at us 

this is a recorded announcement, it said, as im afraid were all out
at the moment  the commercial council of magrathea thanks you for your
esteemed visit   

(a voice from ancient magrathea! shouted zaphod 
they want to get rid of us, said trillian nervously  what do we do?
its just a recording, said zaphod 
we would like to assure you that as soon as our business is resumed
announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines and colour supple-
ments, when our clients will once again be able to select from all thats best in
contemporary geography 
well, i suppose wed better be going then, hadnt we? he suggested 
shhh! said zaphod  theres absolutely nothing to be worried about 
then whys everyone so tense?
theyre just interested! shouted zaphod 
it is most gratifying, it said, that your enthusiasm for our planet con-
tinues unabated, and so we would like to assure you that the guided missiles
currently converging with your ship are part of a special service we extend
to all of our most enthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads
are of course merely a courtesy detail 
oh, said trillian er  
look, said zaphod, will you get it into your heads? thats just a
recorded message  it doesnt apply to us, get it?

what, said trillian quietly, about the missiles?
missiles? dont make me laugh 
ford tapped zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear screen 
clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were climbing through
the atmosphere towards the ship  a quick change of magnication brought
them into close focus  two massively real rockets thundering through the
sky 

i think theyre going to have a very good try at applying to us, said

ford 

zaphod stared at them in astonishment 
but dont you see what this means?
yes 

as a matter of interest, said trillian, what are we going to do?
just keep cool, said zaphod  er   take evasive action! said zaphod with

a sudden access of panic  computer, what evasive action can we take?

er, none im afraid, guys, said the computer  er  
there seems to be something jamming my guidance system, explained
the computer brightly, impact minus forty-ve seconds 

zaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions simultaneously  er   weve got to get manual control of this ship 

id guessed that, said zaphod 

zaphod stared at them wildly 
okay, ford, he said, full retro thrust and ten degrees starboard 

air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was
thrown against them  for a few seconds the inertial forces held them attened
and squirming for breath, unable to move  zaphod struggled and pushed in
manic desperation and nally managed a savage kick at a small lever that
formed part of the guidance system  the ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards  fords copy of the
hitchhikers guide to the galaxy smashed into another section of the control
console with the combined result that the guide started to explain to anyone
who cared to listen about the best ways of smuggling antarean parakeet
glands out of antares (an antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is
a revolting but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of
money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other
very rich idiots), and the ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone  this should be emphasized because, as had
already been revealed, they escape otherwise completely unharmed and the
deadly nuclear missiles do not eventually hit the ship then turn the bloody engines back on! bawled zaphod  with a subtle roar the engines cut back
in, the ship smoothly attened out of its dive and headed back towards the
missiles again  

zaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the din of

what they quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction 

and dont  
the ship, in attening out had in fact attened out upside down and
lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally impossible for any of the
crew to reach the guidance systems 
the two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered to-

wards the ship  
but by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully corrected
their ight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and they passed
right under it  revised impact time fteen

seconds fellas   we are now quite denitely

going to die arent we?

i wish youd stop saying that, shouted ford  well, we are, arent we?
yes  why doesnt anyone
turn on this improbability drive thing? he said 

what are you crazy? said zaphod 
arthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky pieces of

moulded contouring where the curve of the wall met the ceiling  
does anyone know why arthur cant turn on the improbability drive?

shouted trillian and youll never walk alone   impact minus ve seconds, its been

great knowing you guys, god bless   youll ne   ver  

and the next thing that happened after that was that the heart of gold
continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather fetchingly redesigned
interior  in the centre a spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular,
stood in a spray of ferns and yellow owers and next to it a stone sundial
pedestal housed the main computer terminal  cunningly deployed lighting
and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking
a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured garden  looked at from the
correct angles the mirrors appeared to reect all the required data readouts,
though it was far from clear where they were reected from  it was in fact
sensationally beautiful 

relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, zaphod beeblebrox said, what the

hell happened?

well i was just saying, said arthur lounging by a small sh pool,
theres this improbability drive switch over here  

but where are we? said ford who was sitting on the spiral staircase, a

nicely chilled pan galactic gargle blaster in his hand   said trillian, as all about them the
mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape of magrathea which
still scooted along beneath them 
zaphod leapt out of his seat 
then whats happened to the missiles? he said  they would
appear, said ford doubtfully, to have turned into a bowl of petunias and
a very surprised looking whale   at an improbability factor, cut in eddie, who hadnt changed a bit,
of eight million seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand one hundred and
twenty-eight to one against 

zaphod stared at arthur  did you think of that, earthman? he de-

manded  
thats very good thinking you know  turn on the improbability drive
for a second without rst activating the proong screens  
was it? said zaphod 
another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability
a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above
the surface of an alien planet 

and since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor
innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a
whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more  ! whats happening? it thought 
er, excuse me, who am i?
hello?
why am i here? whats my purpose in life?
what do i mean by who am i?
calm down, get a grip now   well i suppose
id better start nding names for things if i want to make any headway in
what for the sake of what i shall call an argument i shall call the world, so
lets call it my stomach  and hey, whats about this
whistling roaring sound going past what im suddenly going to call my head?
perhaps i can call that   wind! is that a good name? itll do   perhaps i
can nd a better name for it later when ive found out what its for  hey! whats this thing? this   hey!
i can can really thrash it about pretty good cant i? wow! wow! that feels
great! doesnt seem to achieve very much but ill probably nd out what its
for later on 
never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to nd out about, so

much to look forward to, im quite dizzy with anticipation  

or is it the wind?
there really is a lot of that now isnt it?
and wow! hey! whats this thing suddenly coming towards me very
fast? very very fast  ow   ound   ground! thats it! thats a good name
 ground!

i wonder if it will be friends with me?
and the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence 
curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl
of petunias as it fell was oh no, not again  many people have speculated
that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would
know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now 

zaphod glanced away from the mirror screens which presented a panoramic
view of the blighted landscape on which the heart of gold had now landed 
but what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?
you think youve got problems, said marvin as if he was addressing a
newly occupied con, what are you supposed to do if you are a manically
depressed robot? no, dont bother to answer that, im fty thousand times
more intelligent than you and even i dont know the answer 

trillian burst in through the door from her cabin 
an expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of zaphods

faces 
trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again 
the voice was oddly familiar, but oddly dierent  it had a matriarchal
twang 
its the computer, explained zaphod now this is going to be your rst day out on a strange new planet,
continued eddies new voice, so i want you all wrapped up snug and warm,
and no playing with any naughty bug-eyed monsters 

zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch 
im sorry, he said, i think we might be better o with a slide rule  who said that?
will you open the exit hatch please, computer? said zaphod trying not

to get angry  he was desperately worried that one day sentinent life forms
would forget how to do this   began zaphod  
im waiting, interrupted eddie   said zaphod again, who had been trying to think of some
subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with, and had decided
not to bother competing with it on its own ground, if you dont open that
exit hatch this moment i shall zap straight o to your major data banks and
reprogram you with a very large axe, got that?
eddie, shocked, paused and considered this 

an icy wind ripped into them, they hugged themselves warmly and stepped

down the ramp on to the barren dust of magrathea 

itll all end in tears, i know it, shouted eddie after them and closed

the hatchway again 

five gures wandered slowly over the blighted land  bits of it were dullish
grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less interesting to look at 

zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it 

the wind stung arthurs eyes and ears, and the stale thin air clasped his

throat  of all the planets in all the star
systems of all the galaxy  didnt he just have to turn up at a dump like
this after fteen years of being a castaway? not even a hot dog stand in
evidence 

no, insisted arthur, dont you understand, this is the rst time ive
actually stood on the surface of another planet  

trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned 

she was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of zaphod
standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to come and join
him 

he seemed to be excited, but they couldnt clearly hear what he was

saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind 

as they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware that
it seemed to be circular  a crater about a hundred and fty yards wide 

with horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat 
at the top of the craters lip they met zaphod 
in the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadnt
lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot  the silence was only
disturbed by the slight involuntary spasms of trillians throat 

i suppose theres no point in trying to bury it? murmured arthur, and

then wished he hadnt 

come, said zaphod and started back down into the crater 
what, down there? said trillian with severe distaste 
yeah, said zaphod, come on, ive got something to show you 
we can see it, said trillian 
come on, insisted zaphod, ive found a way in  the force of
the whales impact cracked it open, and thats where we have to go  where
no man has trod these ve million years, into the very depths of time itself
 
zaphod hit him and he shut up 
with little shudders of disgust they all followed zaphod down the incline

into the crater, trying very hard not to look at its unfortunate creator 

life, said marvin dolefully, loathe it or ignore it, you cant like it 
the ground had caved in where the whale had hit it revealing a network
of galleries and passages, now largely obstructed by collapsed rubble and
entrails  zaphod had made a start clearing a way into one of them, but
marvin was able to do it rather faster  dank air wafted out of its dark
recesses, and as zaphod shone a torch into it, little was visible in the dusty
gloom 

according to the legends, he said, the magratheans lived most of their

lives underground 

whys that? said arthur  did the surface become too polluted or

overpopulated?

no, i dont think so, said zaphod  i think they just didnt like it very

much are you sure you know what youre doing? said trillian peering ner-

vously into the darkness  weve been attacked once already you know  er, hey earthman   what from? you just said theres no one here 
yeah, well, just for safety, okay? said zaphod 
zaphod scrambled down into the passage, followed by trillian and ford 
dont worry, marvin assured him, they will 
arthur stamped around in a hu, and then decided that a whales grave-

yard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in 

marvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself o 

* * *

zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but trying
to hide it by striding purposefully  he ung the torch beam around  magrathea,

and he strode on through the dirt and debris that littered the tile oor 

trillian was reminded unavoidably of the london underground, though

it was less thoroughly squalid 

at intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics  simple
angular patterns in bright colours  trillian stopped and studied one of them
but could not interpret any sense in them  she called to zaphod 

hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?
i think theyre just strange symbols of some kind, said zaphod, hardly

glancing back 

trillian shrugged and hurried after him 
he dragged zaphod into one to have a look  trillian followed 

look, said ford, you reckon this is magrathea   
yeah, said zaphod, and we heard the voice, right?okay, so ive bought the fact that its magrathea  for the moment 
you didnt just look it up in a star atlas, thats for sure  like what?
i dont know 
what?
i dont know what im looking for  i think it might be because if i knew i wouldnt

be able to look for them 

what, are you crazy?
its a possibility i havent ruled out yet, said zaphod quietly 

for a long time nobody said anything as ford gazed at zaphod with a

mind suddenly full of worry  ill tell you something, said zaphod  i freewheel a lot  its like
having a galacticredit card which keeps on working though you never send
o the cheques  its a big eort to talk about
it 

zaphod paused for a while  about the
fact that part of my mind just didnt seem to work properly 
i put the two ideas
together and decided that maybe that somebody had locked o part of my
mind for that purpose, which was why i couldnt use it  i went through every major screening test on both my heads all the tests i had to go through under government medical ocers before
my nomination for presidency could be properly ratied  they showed that i was clever, imag-
inative, irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldnt have
guessed  so i started inventing further tests, com-
pletely at random  finally i got
silly, because id given it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia 
last thing i did before i packed it in was take the superimposed picture and
look at it through a green lter  some bastard had cauterized all the synapses and elec-
tronically traumatised those two lumps of cerebellum  trillian had turned white 
you know? how do you know?
because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses 
well, what were they, for gods sake?
zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment 

ill tell you about it later, choked zaphod as all three passed out 

on the surface of magrathea arthur wandered about moodily 

ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of the hitchhikers guide to the

galaxy to while away the time with 

the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and
contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at
the time 

one of these (the one arthur now came across) supposedly relates the
experiences of one veet voojagig, a quiet young student at the university
of maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient
philology, transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical
perception, and then, after a night of drinking pan galactic gargle blasters
with zaphod beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of
what had happened to all the biros hed bought over the past few years 

there followed a long period of painstaking research during which he vis-
ited all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually
came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination
at the time  somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets
inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, shoids, walking treeoids and superintel-
ligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to
biro life forms  and it was to this planet that unattended biros would make
their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where
they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly
biro-oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the good
life 

and as theories go this was all very ne and pleasant until veet voojagig
suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a
while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables, whereupon
he was taken away, locked up, wrote a book, and was nally sent into tax
exile, which is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make
a fool of themselves in public when one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that voo-
jagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid in-
habited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true,
though he was later discovered to be lying 

there did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000
altairan dollars paid yearly into his brantisvogan bank account, and of course
zaphod beeblebroxs highly protable second-hand biro business  he watched two suns set magnicently over magrathea  he woke the robot up because even

a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody 

the robot obediently looked at them, then looked back  wretched isnt it?
but that sunset! ive never seen anything like it in my wildest dreams

 

ive seen it, said marvin 
we only ever had the one sun at home, persevered arthur, i came

from a planet called earth you know  where are you going?
arthur couldnt bear any more 
i think ill ju st take another walk, he said 
dont blame you, said marvin and counted ve hundred and ninety-

seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later 

he was standing with his back to arthur watching the very last glimmers
of light sink into blackness behind the horizon  but he didnt turn yet, not even to react to arthurs yelp of
surprise  conversation was clearly

something he felt he didnt have to rush at  er    he said, lamely  the slight glow from marvins

eyes cast very faint red shadows on the huge carcass of the whale  ancient comput-
ers ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark millennia, and the
ages hang heavy on their dusty data banks 

he looked gravely at arthur and said, im a great fan of science you

know  er, really? said arthur, who was beginning to nd the mans

curious, kindly manner disconcerting 
ah, said arthur, er    he had an odd felling of being like a man in
the act of adultery who is surprised when the womans husband wanders into
the room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle remarks about the weather
and leaves again  actually you see, we werent really expecting to nd
anybody about in fact 
yes, through the economic recession you see, said the old man, appar-
ently unconcerned about whether arthur understood a word he was talking
about or not 
er, economic recession?
well you see, ve million years ago the galactic economy collapsed, and
seeing that custom-made planets are something of a luxury commodity you
see  
well yes, said arthur, id sort of gathered   
fascinating trade, said the old man, and a wistful look came into his
eyes, doing the coastlines was always my favourite  so anyway, he said trying to nd his thread
again, the recession came and we decided it would save us a lot of bother
if we just slept through it 

the man stied a very slight yawn and continued 
the computers were index linked to the galactic stock market prices you
see, so that wed all be revived when everybody else had rebuilt the economy
enough to aord our rather expensive services thats a pretty unpleasant way to behave isnt it?
is it? asked the old man mildly  im sorry, im a bit out of touch 
no, came a thin metallic voice from the crater, im mine 
if youd call it a robot, muttered arthur  he called to marvin who
crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, which he wasnt 

arthur looked down at marvin, who now made an equally big show of
turning round laboriously and trudging o down into the crater again mut-
tering sour nothings to himself 
ive never been very good at them myself, but im told they can be very
eective 
oh nothing, im sorry, said arthur in embarrassment  magrathea awakes  is slartibartfast 
i beg your pardon? he spluttered 
i said it wasnt important, he said 
the aircar sailed through the night  for instance, on the planet earth, man had always assumed that
he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much 
the wheel, new york, wars and so on  whilst all the dolphins had ever
done was muck about in the water having a good time 

curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruc-
tion of the planet earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind of
the danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amus-
ing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually gave
up and left the earth by their own means shortly before the vogons arrived 
the last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophis-
ticated attempt to do a double-backwardssomersault through a hoop whilst
whistling the star sprangled banner, but in fact the message was this: so
long and thanks for all the sh 

in fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than
dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research labo-
ratories running round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant
and subtle experiments on man 

silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness, a single soft glow of
light that was utterly alone in the deep magrathean night 
arthurs companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, and when arthur tried
on a couple of occasions to engage him in conversation again he would simply
reply by asking if he was comfortable enough, and then left it at that 
he peered at it, but was unable to discern any clear shape, and suddenly
gasped in alarm as the aircraft dipped sharply and headed downwards in
what seemed certain to be a collision course 
after a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he sensed a
slight subsidence in their speed and some while later became aware that they
were gradually gliding to a gentle halt  they were still in the silver tunnel, threadingand weaving their way through what appeared to be a crisscross warren of
converging tunnels  when they nally stopped it was in a small chamber of
curved steel  arthur guessed (quite
wrongly) that it might be ultra violet 

slartibartfast turned and regarded arthur with his solemn old eyes 
earthman, he said, we are now deep in the heart of magrathea  we
are about to pass through a gateway into a vast tract of hyperspace 
slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly  it

scares the willies out of me 

the car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly arthur

had a fairly clear idea of what innity looked like 

it wasnt innity in fact  innity itself looks at and uninteresting  look-
ing up into the night sky is looking into innity  distance is incomprehensible
and therefore meaningless  the chamber into which the aircar emerged was
anything but innite, it was just very very big, so that it gave the impression
of innity far better than innity itself 

arthurs senses bobbed and span, as, travelling at the immense speed
he knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the open air leav-
ing the gateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the
shimmering wall behind them  the wall
was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides passed away
beyond the reach of sight  it would take the nest laser measuring
equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to innity, as it dropped
dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it also curved a hollow sphere, a sphere over three million miles across and ooded with
unimaginable light 

welcome, said slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, trav-
elling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into
the mindboggling space, welcome, he said, to our factory oor  ranged away
before them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a
series of curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light hung about
shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space 

you mean, said arthur, trying to form the words, you mean youre

starting it all up again now?

no no, good heavens no, exclaimed the old man, no, the galaxy isnt
nearly rich enough to support us yet  no, weve been awakened to perform
just one extraordinary commission for very  

arthur followed the old mans nger, till he was able to pick out the
oating structure he was pointing out 
it was indeed the only one of the
many structures that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though this was
more a sublimal impression than anything one could put ones nger on 

at the moment however a ash of light arced through the structure and
revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere
within  patterns that arthur knew, rough blobby shapes that were as familiar
to him as the shapes of words, part of the furniture of his mind  for a few
seconds he sat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and
tried to nd somewhere to settle down and make sense 

part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking
at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to
countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking
in that direction 
well, the earth mark two in fact, said slartibartfast cheerfully  made the earth?

oh yes, said slartibartfast  i think it

was called norway?

no, said arthur, no, i didnt  lovely crinkly edges  five minutes later and it wouldnt have mattered so much 
yes well so i expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled platypuses,

but   

ah, but they hadnt paid for it you see, had they?
look, said arthur, would it save you a lot of time if i just gave up

and went mad now?

for a while the aircar ew on in awkward silence  it was destroyed ve minutes before the completion of the purpose
for which it was built, and weve got to build another one 
indeed earthman 
look, sorry  are we talking about the little white furry things with the
cheese xation and women standing on tables screaming in early sixties sit
coms?

slartibartfast coughed politely 
remember i have been asleep inside this planet of magrathea for ve million
years and know little of these early sixties sit coms of which you speak  they are
merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyperintelligent pandimen-
sional beings  theyve

been experimenting on you im afraid 
they were often used in behavioural research, pavlov and all that sort of
stu  so what happened was hat the mice would be set all sorts of tests,
learning to ring bells, run around mazes and things so that the whole natureof the learning process could be examined  

arthurs voice tailed o  suddenly running down a maze the wrong way, eating the wrong
bit of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis,  if its nely
calculated the cumulative eect is enormous 

he paused for eect 
you see, earthman, they really are particularly clever hyperintelligent
pan-dimensional beings  your planet and people have formed the matrix of
an organic computer running a tenmillion-year research programme   itll take a little time 

there are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the
most popular are why are people born? why do they die? why do they want
to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches?

many many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pandimensional
beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pan-dimensional universe
is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with the constant bickering about
the meaning of life which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of brockian
ultra cricket (a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no
readily apparent reason and then running away) that they decided to sit
down and solve their problems once and for all 

and to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which
was so amazingly intelligent that even before the data banks had been con-
nected up it had started from i think therefore i am and got as far as the
existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it
o 
its main console was installed in a specially designed executive oce,
mounted on an enormous executive desk of nest ultramahagony topped
with rich ultrared leather  the dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous,
exotic pot plants and tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer
programmers and their families were deployed liberally about the room, and
stately windows looked out upon a tree-lined public square 

on the day of the great on-turning two soberly dressed programmers
with brief cases arrived and were shown discreetly into the oce  they were
aware that this day they would represent their entire race in its greatest
moment, but they conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated
themselves deferentially before the desk, opened their brief cases and took
out their leather-bound notebooks 

their names were lunkwill and fook 
for a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after exchanginga quiet glance with fook, lunkwill leaned forward and touched a small black
panel 

the subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now in
total active mode 

it said: what is this great task for which i, deep thought, the second
greatest computer in the universe of time and space have been called into
existence?

lunkwill and fook glanced at each other in surprise   began fook 
no, wait a minute, this isnt right, said lunkwill, worried  we dis-
tinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one ever and were not
making do with second best 

another worried look passed between the two programmers  lunkwill

cleared his throat 

there must be some mistake, he said, are you not a greatest computer
than the milliard gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in
a millisecond?

the milliard gargantubrain? said deep thought with unconcealed con-

tempt  a mere abacus  mention it not 

and are you not, said fook leaning anxiously forward, a greater an-
alyst than the googleplex star thinker in the seventh galaxy of light and
ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle
throughout a ve-week dangrabad beta sand blizzard?

a ve-week sand blizzard? said deep thought haughtily  you ask this
of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the big bang
itself? molest me not with this pocket calculator stu 

the two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment  then

lunkwill leaned forward again 

but are you not, he said, a more endish disputant than the great
hyperlobic omni-cognate neutron wrangler of ciceronicus 12, the magic
and indefatigable?

the great hyperlobic omni-cognate neutron wrangler, said deep
thought thoroughly rolling the r s, could talk all four legs o an arcturan
megadonkey  but only i could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards 

then what, asked fook, is the problem?there is no problem, said deep thought with magnicent ringing tones 

but the second ? insisted lunkwill  why do you keep saying the sec-
ond? youre surely not thinking of the multicorticoid perspicutron titan
muller are you? or the pondermatic? or the   

contemptuous lights ashed across the computers console 
i spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons! he

boomed  i speak of none but the computer that is to come after me!

fook was losing patience  he pushed his notebook aside and muttered,

i think this is getting needlessly messianic 

you know nothing of future time, pronounced deep thought, and yet
in my teeming circuitry i can navigate the innite delta streams of future
probability and see that there must one day come a computer whose merest
operational parameters i am not worthy to calculate, but which it will be my
fate eventually to design 

fook sighed heavily and glanced across to lunkwill 
lunkwill motioned him to wait  fook composed himself  the answer to what?
life! urged fook 
the universe! said lunkwill 
deep thought paused for a moments reection 
tricky, he said nally 
but can you do it?
again, a signicant pause 
there is an answer? said fook with breathless excitement 
a simple answer? added lunkwill 

a sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door ew open and two
angry men wearing the coarse faded-blue robes and belts of the cruxwanuniversity burst into the room, thrusting aside the ineectual unkies who
tried to bar their way 

we demand that you cant keep us out! bawled the younger one, though
he was now rmly inside the room and no further attempts were being made
to stop him 
majikthise turned on vroomfondel  its alright, he explained angrily,

you dont need to demand that 

all right! bawled vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk  i am
vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! what we
demand is solid facts!

no we dont! exclaimed majikthise in irritation  that is precisely

what we dont demand!

scarcely pausing for breath, vroomfondel shouted, we dont demand
solid facts! what we demand is a total absence of solid facts  i demand that
i may or may not be vroomfondel!

but who the devil are you? exclaimed an outraged fook 
though we may not be, said vroomfondel waving a warning nger at

the programmers 

yes we are, insisted majikthise  we are quite denitely here as rep-
resentatives of the amalgamated union of philosophers, sages, luminaries
and other thinking persons, and we want this machine o, and we want it
o now !

whats the problem? said lunkwill 
ill tell you what the problem is mate, said majikthise, demarcation,

thats the problem!

we demand, yelled vroomfondel, that demarcation may or may not

be the problem!

you just let the machines get on with the adding up, warned majikthise,
and well take care of the eternal verities thank you very much 
any bloody machine goes and actually nds it and were straight out of ajob arent we? i mean whats the use of our sitting up half the night arguing
that there may or may not be a god if this machine only goes and gives us
his bleeding phone number the next morning?

thats right! shouted vroomfondel, we demand rigidly dened areas

of doubt and uncertainty!

suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room 
well go on strike! yelled vroomfondel 
thats right! agreed majikthise  youll have a national philosophers

strike on your hands!

the hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary bass
driver units, mounted in sedately carved and varnished cabinet speakers
around the room, cut in to give deep thoughts voice a little more power 

all i wanted to say, bellowed the computer, is that my circuits are now
irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the ultimate question of
life, the universe, and everything  he paused and satised himself that
he now had everyones attention, before continuing more quietly, but the
programme will take me a little while to run 

fook glanced impatiently at his watch 
lunkwill and fook blinked at each other 
yes, declaimed deep thought, i said id have to think about it, didnt
i? and it occurs to me that running a programme like this is bound to create
an enormous amount of popular publicity for the whole area of philosophy
in general  everyones going to have their own theories about what answer
im eventually to come up with, and who better to capitalize on that media
market than you yourself? so long as you can keep disagreeing with each
other violently enough and slagging each other o in the popular press, you
can keep yourself on the gravy train for life  here

vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like that?

dunno, said vroomfondel in an awed whisper, think our brains must

be too highly trained majikthise 

so saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door and into

a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams 

yes, very salutary, said arthur, after slartibartfast had related the salient
points of the story to him, but i dont understand what all this has got to
do with the earth and mice and things 

that is but the rst half of the story earthman, said the old man 
its only half completed im afraid  we havent even nished burying the
articial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet, then we have the tertiary and
quarternary periods of the cenozoic era to lay down, and   

no thank you, said arthur, it wouldnt be quite the same 
no, said slartibartfast, it wont be, and he turned the aircar round

and headed back towards the mind-numbing wall 

slartibartfasts study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a
public library 

terribly unfortunate, he said, a diode blew in one of the life-support
computers  when we tried to revive our cleaning sta we discovered theyd
been dead for nearly thirty thousand years  whos going to clear away the
bodies, thats what i want to know  look why dont you sit yourself down
over there and let me plug you in?

he gestured arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been made

out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus 

it was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus, explained the old man
as he pottered about shing bits of wire out from under tottering piles of
paper and drawing instruments 

the instant he took hold of them a bird ew straight through him  beneath him
was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it as far as the eye could see
were white concrete buildings of airy spacious design but somewhat the worse
for wear  many were cracked and stained with rain  today however the sun
was shining, a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd
sensation that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused
by the fact that the square and all the streets around it were thronged with
cheerful excited people  somewhere a band was playing, brightly coloured
ags were uttering in the breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air 

arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all without
so much as a body to his name, but before he had time to reect on this a
voice rang out across the square and called for everyones attention 

a man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building which

clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd over a tannoy  hon-
oured descendants of vroomfondel and majikthise, the greatest and mosttruly interesting pundits the universe has ever known   the time of wait-
ing is over!

wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd  flags, streamers and wolf
whistles sailed through the air  the narrower streets looked rather like cen-
tipedes rolled over on their backs and frantically waving their legs in the
air  the day of the an-
swer!

hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd 
never again, cried the man, never again will we wake up in the morning
and think who am i? what is my purpose in life? does it really, cosmically
speaking, matter if i dont get up and go to work? for today we will nally
learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little
problems of life, the universe and everything!

as the crowd erupted once again, arthur found himself gliding through
the air and down towards one of the large stately windows on the rst oor
of the building behind the dais from which the speaker was addressing the
crowd 

no one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is hardly
surprising as he wasnt there 

the room was much as slartibartfast had described it  the ultramahagony desk was worn at the edges, the carpet a
little faded now, but the large computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on
the desks leather top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday  the word
was loonquawl, and it ashed a couple of times and the disappeared again 
before arthur was able to assimilate this the other man spoke and the word
phouchg appeared by his neck 

seventy-ve thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this program
in motion, the second man said, and in all that time we will be the rst to
hear the computer speak an awesome prospect, phouchg, agreed the rst man, and arthur sud-

denly realized that he was watching a recording with subtitles  ! said loonquawl  !
shhh, said loonquawl with a slight gesture, i think deep thought is

preparing to speak!

there was a moments expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life
on the front of the console  lights ashed on and o experimentally and
settled down into a businesslike pattern 
er   good morning, o deep thought, said loonquawl nervously, do

you have  

there really is one? breathed phouchg 
there really is one, conrmed deep thought 
both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a
preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness
the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like
excited children 

and youre ready to give it to us? urged loonquawl 
though i dont think, added deep thought, that youre going to like

it 

doesnt matter! said phouchg  the two

men dgeted 

youre really not going to like it, observed deep thought  ?
forty-two, said deep thought, with innite majesty and calm 

out of the corner of his eye phouchg could see the sea of tense expectant

faces down in the square outside 

were going to get lynched arent we? he whispered 
forty-two! yelled loonquawl  is that all youve got to show for seven

and a half million years work?

i checked it very thoroughly, said the computer, and that quite def-
initely is the answer  i think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is
that youve never actually known what the question is 

but it was the great question! the ultimate question of life, the

universe and everything! howled loonquawl 

yes, said deep thought with the air of one who suers fools gladly,

but what actually is it?

a slow stupeed silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer

and then at each other   oered phouchg

weakly  so once you do know what the question

actually is, youll know what the answer means 

oh terric, muttered phouchg inging aside his notebook and wiping

away a tiny tear but can you do it? cried loonquawl 
finally: no, he said rmly 
who? tell us!
suddenly arthur began to feel his apparently non-existent scalp begin to
crawl as he found himself moving slowly but inexorably forward towards the
console, but it was only a dramatic zoom on the part of whoever had made
the recording he assumed 

i speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me, in-
toned deep thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones 
a computer whose merest operational parameters i am not worthy to cal-
culate  and yet i will design it for you  a computer which can calculate
the question to the ultimate answer, a computer of such innite and subtle
complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix 

phouchg gaped at deep thought 
what a dull name, he said and great incisions appeared down the length
of his body  loonquawl too suddenly sustained horric gashed from nowhere 
the computer console blotched and cracked, the walls ickered and crumbled
and the room crashed upwards into its own ceiling  

slartibartfast was standing in front of arthur holding the two wires 
just let me stick to what im good at, yeah? muttered zaphod and

rolled away from the voice back to sleep 
would it give you a lot of pleasure? said zaphod, blearily  so whats the point? stop bugging me  zaphod curled himself

up 

he got a double dose of the gas, said trillian looking down at him, two

windpipes  whats the matter with the ground? its all cold and hard 
with an amazingly balletic movement zaphod was standing and scanning
the horizon, because that was how far the gold ground stretched in every
direction, perfectly smooth and solid  its impossible to
say what it gleamed like because nothing in the universe gleams in quite the
same way that a planet of solid gold does 
dont get excited, said ford, its only a catalogue  he poked it and prodded it with his ngernail  it
was very heavy and very slightly soft  he could mark it with his ngernail 
it was very yellow and very shiny, and when he breathed on it his breath
evaporated o it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates
o solid gold trillian and i came round a while ago, said ford 

zaphod stared at him bitterly 
ah, shit, he said, you wake me up from my own perfectly good dream

to show me somebody elses  he sat down in a hu 

whats that series of valleys over there? he said 
we didnt wake you earlier, said trillian 

fish?
some people like the oddest things  we thought

youd like to see this one though 
very pretty, said zaphod petulantly 

it ickered and

changed, and when they looked around again so had the land 

as with one voice they all went, yuch  nearby stood a
solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and silver tassles  it said,

whatever your tastes, magrathea can cater for you 

and ve hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on parachutes 

ow! said zaphod 

i gure this, said zaphod 
and i did it in such a way that it wouldnt be detected by the government
screening tests  and i wasnt to know anything about it myself 
so i reckon, whats so secret that i cant let anybody know i know it,
not the galactic government, not even myself? and the answer is i dont
know when did i decide to run for president? shortly after the death of president
yooden vranx  you remember yooden, ford?

yeah, said ford, he was that guy we met when we were kids, the
arcturan captain  he gave us conkers when you bust your
way into his megafreighter  said you were the most amazing kid hed ever
met 

whats all this? said trillian 
ancient history, said ford, when we were kids together on betelgeuse 
the arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the bulky trade between
the galactic centre and the outlying regions the betelgeuse trading scouts
used to nd the markets and the arcturans would supply them  there was a
lot of trouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the dordellis
wars, and the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic
defence shields known to galactic science  they were real brutes of ships,
and huge 

one day, young zaphod here decides to raid one  on a tri-jet scooter
designed for stratosphere work, a mere kid  i mean forget it, it was crazier
than a mad monkey 
i went along for the ride because id got some very
safe money on him not doing it, and didnt want him coming back with fake
evidence  so what happens? we got in his tri-jet which he had souped up
into something totally other, crossed three parsecs in a matter of weeks, bust
our way into a megafreighter i still dont know how, marched on to the bridge
waving toy pistols and demanded conkers  for what? conkers 

the captain was this really amazing guy, yooden vranx, said zaphod 
he gave us food, booze  stu from really weird parts of the galaxy 
lots of conkers of course, and we had just the most incredible time  then
he teleported us back  into the maximum security wing of betelgeuse state
prison 

zaphod paused  dark mists
swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shad-
ows  the air was occasionally rent with the sounds of illusory beings mur-
dering other illusory beings 

ford, said zaphod quietly 
yeah?
just before yooden died he came to see me 

are you telling me, he said, that you set yourself up to become pres-

ident of the galaxy just to steal that ship?

thats it, said zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people

locked away in a room with soft walls  whats so important about having it?
dunno, said zaphod, i think if id consciously known what was so
important about it and what i would need it for it would have showed up
on the brain screening tests and i would never have passed  i think yooden
told me a lot of things that are still locked away 

so you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as a

result of yooden talking to you?

he was a hell of a talker 
yeah, but zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself you know 
zaphod shrugged 
i mean, dont you have any inkling of the reasons for all this? asked

ford 

zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his mind 
no, he said at last, i dont seem to be letting myself into any of my
i

secrets 
wouldnt trust myself further than i could spit a rat 

a tall magrathean man was standing in front of them  he picked up
a paper from the top of a pile, but then couldnt think of anywhere else to
put it, so he but it back on top of the original pile which promptly fell over 

and the vogons came and destroyed it ve minutes before the program
was completed, added arthur, not unbitterly  ten million years, earthman   can you con-
ceive of that kind of time span? a galactic civilization could grow from a
single worm ve times over in that time  well thats
bureaucracy for you, he added 
all through my life ive had this strange unaccountable feeling that something
was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would
tell me what it was 

no, said the old man, thats just perfectly normal paranoia  who cares? said slartibartfast before arthur got too excited 
perhaps im old and tired, he continued, but i always think that the
chances of nding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that
the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself
occupied  look at me: i design coastlines 

he rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large perspex

block with his name on it and a model of norway moulded into it 

wheres the sense in that? he said  none that ive been able to make
out  ive been doing fjords in all my life  for a eeting moment they become
fashionable and i get a major award he turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside carelessly,

but not so carelessly that it didnt land on something soft 

in this replacement earth were building theyve given me africa to do
and of course im doing it with all fjords again because i happen to like them,
and im old fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely baroque feel
to a continent  what does it matter? science has achieved some
wonderful things of course, but id far rather be happy than right any day  thats where it all falls down of course  it sounded like quite a good lifestyle

otherwise 

somewhere on the wall a small white light ashed 

what were the rst two?
oh, probably just coincidences, said slartibartfast carelessly 

arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, at the
sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on thursday
morning 

i seem to be having tremendous diculty with my lifestyle, he muttered

to himself 

for instance, at the very moment that arthur said i seem to be having
tremendous diculty with my lifestyle, a freak wormhole opened up in the
fabric of the space-time continuum and carried his words far far back in time
across almost innite reaches of space to a distant galaxy where strange and
warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle 
a dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the
vlhurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the
ggugvuntt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green sweet-smelling
steam, and, with a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised
to unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged the vile
creature to take back what it had said about his mother 

the creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment
the words i seem to be having tremendous diculty with my lifestyle drifted
across the conference table 

unfortunately, in the vlhurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult
imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries 
eventually of course, after their galaxy had been decimated over a few
thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a ghastly
mistake, and so the two opposing battle eets settled their few remaining
dierences in order to launch a joint attack on our own galaxy  now posi-
tively identied as the source of the oending remark 

for thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes
of space and nally dived screaming on to the rst planet they came across
 which happened to be the earth  where due to a terrible miscalculation
of scale the entire battle eet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog 

those who study the complex interplay of cause and eect in the history
of the universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time, but thatwe are powerless to prevent it 

a short aircar trip brought arthur and the old magrathean to a doorway 
they left the car and went through the door into a waiting room full of
glass-topped tables and perspex awards  almost immediately, a light ashed
above the door at the other side of the room and they entered 

arthur! youre safe! a voice cried 
the lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to see
ford, trillian and zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully decked out
with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats and bizarre fruits 
well, said zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, our guests
here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird
and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us  here, he
said hoiking out a lump of evil smelling meat from a bowl, have some vegan
rhinos cutlet  what hosts? i dont see any   oh, im sorry, i wasnt quite

prepared for   

let me introduce you, said trillian  arthur this is benji mouse  but arent they  

could you pass me that bowl of grated arcturan megadonkey? she

said slartibartfast coughed politely 
yes, thank you slartibartfast, said benji mouse sharply, you may go  he swivelled
his pink little eyes  you cant mean that! ive got a

thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over africa!

well perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you dismantle

them, said frankie, acidly  those glaciers are works of art!
elegantly sculptured contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic ravines!
it would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art!

thank you slartibartfast, said benji rmly  well, goodbye

earthman, he said to arthur, hope the lifestyle comes together 
now, said benji mouse, to business 
ford and zaphod clinked their glasses together  i beg your pardon? said benji  fi-
nally they composed themselves, and benji moved forward to address arthur 
now, earth creature, he said, the situation we have in eect is this 
we have, as you know, been more or less running your planet for the last
ten million years in order to nd this wretched thing called the ultimate
question 
no  we already thought of that one, said frankie interrupting, but it

doesnt t the answer  you see, it doesnt work  and this is more or less the point  were sick to the teeth
with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again on account
of those whinnet-ridden vogons quite frankly gives me the screaming heebyjeebies, you know what i mean? it was by the merest lucky chance that benji
and i nished our particular job and left the planet early for a quick holiday,
and have since manipulated our way back to magrathea by the good oces
of your friends 

magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension, put in benji 
since when, continued his murine colleague, we have had an oer of
a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5d chat show and lecture circuit
back in our own dimensional neck of the woods, and were very much inclined
to take it 

i would, wouldnt you ford? said zaphod promptingly 
but weve got to have a product you see, said frankie, i mean ideally

we still need the ultimate question in some form or other 

zaphod leaned forward to arthur 
you see, he said, if theyre just sitting there in the studio looking
very relaxed and, you know, just mentioning that they happen to know the
answer to life, the universe and everything, and then eventually have to
admit that in fact its forty-two, then the shows probably quite short 

we have to have something that sounds good, said benji  an ultimate ques-

tion that sounds good? from a couple of mice?

the mice bristled 
well, i mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes the
pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point im afraid where
you begin to suspect that if theres any real truth, its that the entire multi-
dimensional innity of the universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch
of maniacs  and if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten
million years nding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money
and running, then i for one could do with the exercise, said frankie 
hey, will you get this, earthman, interrupted zaphod  you are a last
generation product of that computer matrix, right, and you were there right
up to the moment your planet got the nger, yeah?

er   
so your brain was an organic part of the penultimate conguration of

the computer programme, said ford, rather lucidly he thought 

right? said zaphod  he wasnt aware of ever having felt an

organic part of anything in other words, said benji, steering his curious little vehicle right over to
arthur, theres a good chance that the structure of the question is encoded
in the structure of your brain  so we want to buy it o you 
yes, said ford and trillian 
for lots of money, said zaphod 
what!
well, who would miss it? inquired benjy 

oh yes, said frankie, but wed have to get it out rst 

treated, said benji 
diced 

it could always be replaced, said benji reasonably, if you think its

important 

yes, an electronic brain, said frankie, a simple one would suce 
yeah, said zaphod with a sudden evil grin, youd just have to program
it to say what? and i dont understand and wheres the tea?  whod know
the dierence?

what? cried arthur, backing away still further 
see what i mean? said zaphod and howled with pain because of some-

thing that trillian did at that moment 

id notice the dierence, said arthur 
no you wouldnt, said frankie mouse, youd be programmed not to 
look, im sorry, mice old lads, he said  i dont think weve got a deal 
i rather think we have to have a deal, said the mice in chorus, all
the charm vanishing fro their piping little voices in an instant 

trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him to-
wards the door, which ford and zaphod were struggling to open, but arthur
was dead weight  he seemed hypnotized by the airborne rodents swooping
towards him with one more yank, ford and zaphod got the door open  on the other
side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they could only assume
were the heavy mob of magrathea 

so  arthur was about to have his head cut open, trillian was unable to
help him, and ford and zaphod were about to be set upon by several thugs
a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than they were 

emergency! emergency! blared the klaxons throughout magrathea  armed intruders in section 8a  defence sta-
tions, defence stations!

the two mice snied irritably round the fragments of their glass trans-
ports where they lay shattered on the oor  damnation, muttered frankie
mouse, all that fuss over two pounds of earthling brain  how about whats yellow and

dangerous? 

benji considered this for a moment  doesnt t the answer 
all right, said benji  what do you get if you multiply six by seven?
no, no, too literal, too factual, said frankie, wouldnt sustain the

punters interest 
then frankie said: heres a thought  how many roads must a man walk

down? 

ah, said benji  yes, he said, thats excellent! sounds very
signicant without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all  excellent, excellent, thatll
fox em 
near them on the oor lay several rather ugly men who had been hit

about the head with some heavy design awards 

half a mile away, four gures pounded up a corridor looking for a wayout 
at a wild guess, id say down here, said zaphod, running o down
to the right between a computer bank and the wall 

a voice on a bullhorn said, okay beeblebrox, hold it right there  weve

got you covered 

at the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and spacesuited

gure waving a vicious kill-o-zap gun 

we dont want to shoot you, beeblebrox! shouted the gure 

suits me ne! shouted zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between

two data process units 
there are two of them, said trillian 

hey, theyre shooting at us, said arthur, crouching in a tight ball, i

thought they said they didnt want to do that 
zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment 
hey, he said, i thought you said you didnt want to shoot us! and

ducked again 
after a moment a voice replied, it isnt easy being a cop!
what did he say? whispered ford in astonishment 
he said it isnt easy being a cop 
well surely thats his problem isnt it?
id have thought so 
ford shouted out, hey listen! i think weve got enough problems on our
own having you shooting at us, so if you could avoid laying your problemson us as well, i think wed all nd it easier to cope!

another pause, and then the bullhorn again 
now see here, guy, said the voice, youre not dealing with any dumb
two-bit trigger-pumping morons with low hairlines, little piggy eyes and no
conversation, were a couple of intelligent caring guys that youd probably
quite like if you met us socially!
i dont go around gratuitously shooting
people and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy space-rangers bars,
like some cops i could mention! i go around shooting people gratuitously
and then i agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!

and i write novels! chimed in the other cop  though i havent had

any of them published yet, so i better warn you, im in a meeeean mood!

fords eyes popped halfway out of their sockets 
a millisecond later the air about them started to fry again, as bolt after

bolt of kill-o-zap hurled itself into the computer bank in front of them 

the fusillade continued for several seconds at unbearable intensity 
we didnt enjoy doing that at all, shouted the other cop 
now, listen to this, beeblebrox, and you better listen good!
why? shouted back zaphod 
because, shouted the cop, its going to be very intelligent, and quite
interesting and humane! now either you all give yourselves up now and let
us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course because we are rmly
opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly
one or two others we noticed on our way out here!

but thats crazy! cried trillian  you wouldnt do that!
oh yes we would, shouted the cop, wouldnt we? he asked the other

one 
but why? demanded trillian  because there are some things you
have to do even if you are an enlightened liberal cop who knows all about
sensitivity and everything!

i just dont believe these guys, muttered ford, shaking his head 

quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence afterwards

was punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and thuds 
they stopped, said zaphod with a shrug 
thats odd 
they havent the wit 
what were those thuds?
dunno 
right, said ford, im going to have a look  ford peered

through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning computer 
twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the space-suited
gure of one of the cops 
slowly, nervously, he walked towards the rst one  the body lay reassur-
ingly still as he approached it, and continued to lie reassuringly still as he
reached it and put his foot down on the kill-o-zap gun that still dangled
from its limp ngers 
a quick examination revealed him to be from blagulon kappa  he was a
methane-breathing life form, dependent on his space suit for survival in the
thin oxygen atmosphere of magrathea 

the tiny life-support system computer on his backpack appeared unex-

pectedly to have blown up  such a sys-
tem was fail-safe in all circumstances other than total feedback malfunction,
which was unheard of 

lets get shot out of this hole, said zaphod  if whatever im supposed
to be looking for is here, i dont want it  he very nearly blasted hell out of an
aircar that stood waiting for them a few yards away  the aircar was empty,
but arthur recognized it as belonging to slartibartfast 

the aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of r17 through the steel tunnels
that lead out onto the appalling surface of the planet which was now in the
grip of yet another drear morning twilight 

r is a velocity measure, dened as a reasonable speed of travel that
is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say
ve minutes late  it is therefore clearly an almost innitely variable gure
according to circumstances, since the rst two factors vary not only with
speed taken as an absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor  unless
handled with tranquility this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers
and even death 

r17 is not a xed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast 
the aircar ung itself through the air at r17 and above, deposited them
next to the heart of gold which stood starkly on the frozen ground like
a bleached bone, and then precipitately hurled itself back in the direction
whence they had come, presumably on important business of its own 
it was the blagulon kappa policecraft, a bulbous sharklike aair, slate
green in colour and smothered with black stencilled letters of varying degrees
of size and unfriendliness 

it seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship whose two-
man crew was at that moment lying asphyxicated in a smoke-lled chamber
several miles beneath the ground  in his experience the universesimply didnt work like that 

the other three could sense it too, but they could sense the bitter cold
even more and hurried back into the heart of gold suering from an acute
attack of no curiosity 

ford stayed, and went to examine the blagulon ship  as he walked, he

nearly tripped over an inert steel gure lying face down in the cold dust  what are you doing?
dont feel you have to take any notice of me, please, came a mued

drone 
whats up?
i dont know, said marvin, ive never been there 
why, said ford squatting down beside him and shivering, are you

lying face down in the dust?

its a very eective way of being wretched, said marvin  dont pretend

you want to talk to me, i know you hate me 

no i dont 

he jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the opposite

direction 

that ship hated me, he said dejectedly, indicating the policecraft 

that night, as the heart of gold was busy putting a few light years between
itself and the horsehead nebula, zaphod lounged under the small palm tree
on the bridge trying to bang his brain into shape with massive pan galactic
gargle blasters; ford and trillian sat in a corner discussing life and matters
arising from it; and arthur took to his bed to ip through fords copy of the
hitchhikers guide to the galaxy  since he was going to live in the place, he
reasoned, hed better start nding out something about it 

for instance, the rst phase is characterized by the question how can
we eat? the second by the question why do we eat? and the third by the
question where shall we have lunch?

he got no further before the ships intercom buzzed into life 
hey earthman? you hungry kid? said zaphods voice 
er, well yes, a little peckish i suppose, said arthur 
okay, baby, hold tight, said zaphod 
many races believe that it was created by some sort of god, though the ja-
travartid people of viltvodle vi believe that the entire universe was in fact
sneezed out of the nose of a being called the great green arkleseizure 
however, the great green arkleseizure theory is not widely accepted outside
viltvodle vi and so, the universe being the puzzling place it is, other expla-
nations are constantly being sought 
for instance, a race of hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings once built them-
selves a gigantic supercomputer called deep thought to calculate once and for
all the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything 
and this computer, which was called the earth, was so large that it was fre-
quently mistaken for a planet - especially by the strange ape-like beings who
roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic
computer program 
sadly however, just before the critical moment of readout, the earth was un-6

expectedly demolished by the vogons to make way - so they claimed - for a
new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of discovering a meaning for life was
lost for ever 
arthur dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his,
ford prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet in the vicinity of
betelgeuse and not from guildford as he had hitherto claimed; and, more to
the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers 
tricia mcmillian - or trillian - had skipped the planet six months earlier with
zaphod beeblebrox, the then president of the galaxy 
and, less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily
through the inky blackness of space, a vogon ship is moving slowly towards
them 



like all vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much designed as con-
gealed  the unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices which protuded from it at
unsightly angles would have disfigured the looks of most ships, but in this case
that was sadly impossible 
in fact to see anything much uglier than a vogon ship you would have to go
inside and look at a vogon  if you are wise, however, this is precisely what you
will avoid doing because the average vogon will not think twice before doing
something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been
born - or (if you are a clearer minded thinker) that the vogon had never been
born 
in fact, the average vogon probably wouldnt even think once  anatomical analysis of the vogon reveals that its
brain was originally a badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver 
one thing they dont like is leaving a job unfinished - particularly this vogon,
and particularly - for various reasons - this job 
this vogon was captain prostetnic vogon jeltz of the galactic hyperspace
planning council, and he was it who had had the job of demolishing the so-
called planet earth 
he heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill-fitting, slimy seat and
stared at the monitor screen on which the starship heart of gold was being
systematically scanned  aesthetics8

chapter 1 
it mattered even less to him that zaphod beeblebrox was aboard  zaphod
beeblebrox was now the ex-president of the galaxy, and though every police
force in the galaxy was currently pursuing both him and this ship he had
stolen, the vogon was not interested 
it has been said that vogons are not above a little bribery and corruption in
the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and this was certainly true
in his case  when he heard the words integrity or moral rectitude, he
reached for his dictionary, and when he heard the chink of ready money in
large quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away 
in seeking so implacably the destruction of the earth and all that therein lay
he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his professional duty 
within a few seconds the face of gag halfrunt appeared on the screen, smiling
the smile of a man who knew he was ten light years away from the vogon
face he was looking at  though the vogon persistently referred to him as my private brain care
specialist there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it was in fact
halfrunt who was employing the vogon  as one of the galaxys most prominent
and successful psychiatrists, he and a consortium of his colleagues were quite
prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future
of psychiatry might be at stake 
well, he said, hello my captain of vogons prostetnic, and how are we feel-
ing today?
the vogon captain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped out nearly
half his crew in a disciplinary exercise 
halfrunts smile did not flicker for an instant 
well, he said, i think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a vogon, you
know? the natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into
acts of senseless violence 
wonderful, said halfrunt, wonderful! and the occupants?
the earthman is there 
good, good, beamed halfrunt, who else?
the man prefect 
yes?
and zaphod beeblebrox 
for an instant halfrunts smile flickered 
no, said halfrunt cheerfully, we just dont have the knack 
he toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it 
what about beeblebrox?
well, said halfrunt brightly, zaphods just this guy, you know?
he vanished from the screen 
the vogon captain pressed a communicator button which connected him with
the remains of his crew 
at that precise moment zaphod beeblebrox was in his cabin swearing very
loudly  two hours ago, he had said that they would go for a quick bite at the
restaurant at the end of the universe, whereupon he had had a blazing row
with the ships computer and stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would
work out the improbability factors with a pencil 
the heart of golds improbability drive made it the most powerful and un-
predictable ship in existence  there was nothing it couldnt do, provided you
knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would
ever happen 

didnt know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he liked it 
he didnt know why he had become president of the galaxy, except that it
seemed a fun thing to be  he wished the dark,
locked off section of his two brains would go away because they occasionally
surfaced momentarily and put strange thoughts into the light, fun sections of
his mind and tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business
of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time 
at that same precise moment, ford prefect was in mid air  it was
a very high jump to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled, re-
covered, raced down the corridor sending a couple of miniature service robots
flying, skidded round the corner, burst into zaphods door and explained what
was on his mind , because he knew that the only source of hot drinks on the entire
ship was a benighted piece of equipment produced by the sirius cybernetics
corporation  when put to the
test, however, it invariably produced a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was
almost, but nit quite, entirely unlike tea 
share and enjoy is the company motto of the hugely successful sirius cy-
bernetics corporation complaints division, which now covers the major land
masses of three medium sized planets and is the only part of the corporation
to have shown a consistent profit in recent years 

11

the motto stands - or rather stood - in three mile high illuminated letters near
the complaints department spaceport on eadrax 
listen, you machine, he said, you claim you can synthesize any drink in
existence, so why do you keep giving me the same undrinkable stuff?
nutrition and pleasurable sense data, burbled the machine  will you try to compre-
hend what im telling you? that drink  
ah, said arthur, so im a masochist on diet am i?
share and enjoy 
then he decided hed be dammed if hed give up  he told
it about silver teapots  he
told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldnt get scalded 
so thats it, is it? said the nutri-matic when he had finished 

im going to need some help with this one, said the machine tersely  all the
cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice and it now meant business 
youve done quite enough, the nutri-matic informed him  around it blazed
the billion pinpricks of the galaxy  towards it crept the ugly yellow lump of
the vogon ship 



does anyone have a kettle? arthur asked as he walked on to the bridge, and
instantly began to wonder why trillian was yelling at the computer to talk to
her, ford was thumping it and zaphod was kicking it, and also why there was
a nasty yellow lump on the vision screen 
at that moment zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble surfaces
that contained the instruments that controlled the conventional photon drive  the photon drive gave a sickly
judder and cut out again 
hey, didja hear that? muttered zaphod as he leapt now for the manual
controls of the infinite improbability drive, the monkey spoke!
the improbability drive gave two small whines and then also cut out 
pure history, man, said zaphod, kicking the improbability drive, a talking
monkey!
if youre upset about something  
vogons! snapped ford, were under attack!
arthur gibbered  theres no power anywhere in the ship  he had not been at all good at it, and his
particular speciality had been scoring own goals in important matches 
the image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering boys flinging it at him
suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment 
their eyes were riveted on him 
and, er   well thats it really, just asking 
zaphod put out a hand and held arthur by the scruff of the neck 
thats right guys, the computer sang out suddenly, just coping with that
problem right now, and wow, its a biggy 
as if to relieve the tension, the vogons chose that moment to start firing  outside, the inch thick force-shield around
it blistered, crackled and spat under the barrage of a dozen 30-megahurt
definit-kil photrazon cannon, and looked as if it wouldnt be around for
long  four minutes is how long ford prefect gave it 
will you stop counting! snarled zaphod 
aboard the vogon ship, prostetnic vogon jeltz was puzzled  he had expected

15

a chase, he had expected an exciting grapple with tractor beams, he had ex-
pected to have to use the specially installed sub-cyclic normality assert-i-
tron to counter the heart of golds infinite improbability drive, but the
sub-cyclic normality assert-i-tron lay idle as the heart of gold just sat there
and took it 
a dozen 30-megahurt definit-kil photrazon cannon continued to blaze away
at the heart of gold, and still it just sat there and took it 
he tested every sensor at his disposal to see if there was any subtle trickery
afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found 
he didnt know about the tea of course 
quite how zaphod beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a seance at this
point is something he was never quite clear on 
obviously the subject of death was in the air, but more as something to be
avoided than harped upon 
possibly the horror that zaphod experienced at the prospect of being reunited
with his deceased relatives led on to the thought that they might just feel the
same way about him and, whats more, be able to do something about helping
to postpone this reunion  the
light was getting dimmer - all the energy the computer didnt require for think-
ing about tea was being pumped into the rapidly fading force-field 
yeah! insisted zaphod 
ok, round the central console 
they clustered round the central console in confusion, sat down and, feeling
exceptionally foolish, held hands  with his third hand zaphod turned off the
lights 
zaphod beeblebrox the fourth 
what?
zaphod beeblebrox the fourth  listen, im zaphod beeblebrox, my father was zaphod beeblebrox the
second, my grandfather zaphod beeblebrox the third   now con-
centrate!
three minutes, said ford prefect 
why, said arthur dent, are we doing this?
shut up, suggested zaphod beeblebrox 
trillian said nothing  what, she thought, was there to say?
the only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a far corner
where marvin the paranoid android sat slumped, ignoring all and ignored by
all, in a private and rather unpleasant world of his own 
round the central console four figures hunched in tight concentration trying
to blot from their minds the terrifying shuddering of the ship and the fearful
roar that echoed through it 
on zaphods brow stood beads of sweat, first of concentration, then of frus-
tration and finally of embarrassment 
at last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his hands from trillian and
ford and stabbed at the light switch 
ah, i was beginning to think youd never turn the lights on, said a voice 
no, not too bright please, my eyes arent what they once were 
four figures jolted upright in their seats  slowly they turned their heads to
look, though their scalps showed a distinct propensity to try and stay in the
same place  who disturbs me at this time? said the small, bent, gaunt figure
standing by the sprays of fern at the far end of the bridge  his two small
wispy-haired heads looked so ancient that it seemed they might hold dim mem-
ories of the birth of the galaxies themselves  one lolled in sleep, but the other
squinted sharply at them  if his eyes werent what they once were, they must
once have been diamond cutters 

17

zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment  he gave the intricate little double
nod which is the traditional betelgeusian gesture of familial respect  er, hi great granddad   zaphod beeblebrox  zaphod
beeblebrox the nothingth  zaphod hated his voice 
er, yeah, he muttered, er, look, im really sorry about the flowers, i meant
to send them along, but you know, the shop was fresh out of wreaths and  
you forget! snapped zaphod beeblebrox the fourth 
zaphod fidgeted nervously  but
first weve just got to  
your late great grandmother and i are very well, rasped zaphod beeblebrox
the fourth 
but very disappointed in you, young zaphod   zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this conver-
sation, and fords heavy breathing at his side told him that the seconds were
ticking away fast  the noise and the shaking had reached terrifying propor-
tions  he saw trillian and arthurs faces white and unblinking in the gloom 
weve been following your progress with considerable despondency  
i mean what exactly are you doing with your life?
im being attacked by a vogon fleet! cried zaphod 
doesnt surprise me in the least, said the little old figure with a shrug 
only its happening right now you see, insisted zaphod feverishly 
er   great granddad  
did you know, interrupting the ghostly figure, fixing zaphod with a stern
look, that betelgeuse five has developed a very slight eccentricy in its orbit?
zaphod didnt and found the information hard to concentrate on what with
all the noise and the imminence of death and so on 
me spinning in my grave! barked the ancestor  he slammed the cup down
and pointed a quivering, stick-like see-through finger at zaphod 
help? exclaimed the old man as if hed been asked for a stoat 
help! repeated the old man as if hed been asked for a lightly grilled stoat
in a bun with french fries 
you go swanning your way round the galaxy with your  
well, i dont know, young zaphod, he continued, i think ill have to think
about this one 
one minute ten, said ford hollowly 
zaphod beeblebrox the fourth peered at him curiously 
those numbers, said zaphod tersely, are the time weve got left to live  doesnt apply to
me, of course, he said and moved off to a dimmer recess of the bridge in
search of something else to poke around at 
zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and wondered if he
shouldnt just jump over and have done with it 
what?
what use is your life to anyone? when i think of what youve made of it the
phrase pigs ear comes irresistibly to my mind 
but i was president of the galaxy, man!
huh, muttered his ancestor, and what kind of a job is that for a beeble-
brox?
hey, what? only president you know! of the whole galaxy!
conceited little megapuppy 
zaphod blinked in bewilderment  this had the effect of reminding zaphod that he was
talking to a ghost because he didnt feel a thing 
you know and i know what being president means, young zaphod  you know
because youve been it, and i know because im dead and it gives one such a
wonderfully uncluttered perspective 
yeah, said zaphod bitterly, very good  right now i need apho-
risms like i need holes in my heads 
fifty seconds, grunted ford prefect 
where was i? said zaphod beeblebrox the fourth 
pontificating, said zaphod beeblebrox 
can this guy, muttered ford quietly to zaphod, actually in fact help us?
nobody else can, whispered zaphod 
ford nodded despondently  if theyd found my head full of tricksy ideas id have
been right out on the streets again with nothing but a fat pension, secretarial
staff, a fleet of ships and a couple of slit throats 
ive slowed down time for a moment, he said, just for a moment you un-
derstand 
no, you listen to me, you see-through old bat, said zaphod leaping out of
his chair, a - thanks for stopping time and all that, great, terrific, wonderful,
but b - no thanks for the homily, right? i dont know what this great think
im meant to be doing is, and it looks to me as if i was supposed not to know  fine, so far so hoopy  except that the
old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own brain - my own brain
- and locked off the bits that knew and cared, because if i knew and cared i
wouldnt be able to do it  i wouldnt be able to go and be president, and i
wouldnt be able to steal this ship, which must be the important thing 
but this former self of mine killed himself off, didnt he, by changing my
brain? ok, that was his choice  thats what he wanted, thats what he
got  well, i dont want to know, and
i dont want to hear them  thats my choice  im not going to be anybodys
puppet, particularly not my own 
zaphod banged the console in fury, oblivious to the dumbfolded looks he was
attracting 
the old me is dead! he raved, killed himself! the dead shouldnt hang
about trying to interfere with the living!
and yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape, said the ghost 
ah, said zaphod, sitting down again, well thats different isnt it?
he grinned at trillian, weakly 
zaphod, rasped the apparition, i think the only reason i waste my breath
on you is that being dead i dont have any other use for it 
ok, said zaphod, why dont you tell me what the big secret is 
zaphod, you knew when you were president of the galaxy, as did yooden
vranx before you, that the president is nothing 
why?

21

why? exclaimed an astonished ghost, why? look around you lad, does it
look to you as if its in very good hands?
its alright  you will simply take this ship, this improbability
drive ship to where it is needed  dont think you can es-
cape your purpose  the improbability field controls you, you are in its grip 
whats this?
he was standing tapping at one of the terminals of eddie the shipboard com-
puter  zaphod told him 
whats it doing?
it is trying, said zaphod with wonderful restraint, to make tea  now zaphod, he said,
turning and wagging a finger at him, i dont know if you are really capable of
succeeding in your job  the principal reason i am
helping you now is that i couldnt bear the thought of you and your modern
friends slouching about up here 
oh, and zaphod?
er, yeah?
if you ever find you need help again, you know, if youre in trouble, need a
hand out of a tight corner  
yeah?
please dont hesitate to get lost 
within the space of one second, a bolt of light flashed from the wizened old
ghosts hands to the computer, the ghost vanished, the bridge filled with bil-
lowing smoke and the heart of gold leapt an unknown distance through the
dimensions of time and space 



ten light years away, gag halfrunt jacked up his smile by several notches  as
he watched the picture on his vision screen, relayed across the sub-ether from
the bridge of the vogon ship, he saw the final shreds of the heart of golds
force-shield ripped away, and the ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke 
the final end of this dangerous (to the psychiatric profession) and subversive
(also to the psychiatric profession) experiment to find the question to the ul-
timate question of life, the universe, and everything, he thought 
familys always embarrassing isnt it? said ford to zaphod as the smoke
began to clear 
wheres zaphod? he said 
arthur and trillian looked about blankly  they were pale and shaken and
didnt know where zaphod was 
marvin? said ford, wheres zaphod?
a moment later he said:
wheres marvin?
the robots corner was empty  nowhere was there any trace of zaphod or
of marvin 
on the delivery plate of the nutri-matic drink synthesizer was a small tray,
on which sat three bone china cups and saucers, a bone china jug of milk, a
silver teapot full of the best tea arthur had ever tasted, and a small printed
note saying wait 



ursa minor beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in the known
universe 
although it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny and more full of won-
derfully exciting people than a pomegranate is of pips, it can hardly be in-
significant that when a recent edition of playbeing magazine headlined an
article with the words when you are tired of ursa minor beta you are tired
of life, the suicide rate quadrupled overnight 
not that there are any nights on ursa minor beta 
no adequate explanation for this has been forthcoming from the dominant
lifeforms on ursa minor beta, who spend most of their time attempting to
achieve spiritual enlightenment by running round swimming pools, and invit-
ing investigation officials form the galactic geo-temporal control board to
have a nice diurnal anomaly 
there is only one city on ursa minor beta, and that is only called a city
because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on the ground there than else-
where 
if you approach light city by air - and there is no other way of approaching
it, no roads, no port facilities - if you dont fly they dont want to see you in
light city - you will see why it has this name 

the building is the home of a book, and was built here on the proceeds of
an extraordinary copyright law suit fought between the books editors and a
breakfast cereal company 
it is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most successful, books ever to
come out of the great publishing corporations of ursa minor - more popular
than life begins at five hundred and fifty, better selling than the big bang
theory - a personal view by eccentrica gallumbits (the triple breasted whore
of eroticon six) and more controversial than oolon colluphids latest block-
busting title everything you never wanted to know about sex but have
been forced to find out 
(and in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the outer eastern rim
of the galaxy, it has long surplanted the great encyclopaedia galactica as
the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many
omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate,
it scores over the older and more pedestrian work in two important respects 
first, it is slightly cheaper, and secondly it has the words dont panic printed
in large friendly letters on its cover )
it is of course that invaluable companion for all those who want to see the
marvels of the known universe for less than thirty altairan dollars a day -
the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy 
if you stood with your back to the main entrance lobby of the guide offices
(assuming you had landed by now and freshened up with a quick dip and
shower) and then walked east, you would pass along the leafy shade of life
boulevard, be amazed by the pale golden colour of the beaches stretching away
to your left, astounded by the mind-surfers floating carelessly along two feet
above the waves as if it was nothing special, surprised and eventually slightly
irritated by the giant palm trees that hum toneless nothings throughout the
daylight hours, in other words continuously 
if you then walked to the end of life boulevard you would enter the lalama-
tine district of shops, bolonut trees and pavement cafes where the um-betans
come to relax after a hard afternoons relaxation on the beach  the lalama-
tine district is one of those very few areas which doesnt enjoy a perpetual
saturday afternoon - it enjoys instead the cool of a perpetual early saturday
evening 
if, on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of eveningtime - call it what you
will - you had approached the second pavement cafe on the right you would
have seen the usual crowd of um- betans chatting, drinking, looking very re-
laxed, and casually glancing at each others watches to see how expensive they
were 

27

you would also have seen a couple of rather dishevelled looking hitch-hikers
from algol who had recently arrived on an arcturan megafreighter aboard
which they had been roughing it for a few days  they were angry and bewil-
dered to discover that here, within sight of the hitch hikers guide building
itself, a simple glass of fruit juice cost the equivalent of over sixty altairan
dollars 
if at that moment you had then looked at the next table but one you would
have seen zaphod beeblebrox sitting and looking very startled and confused 
the reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had been sitting
on the bridge of the starship heart of gold 
zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two dishevelled
hitch-hikers at the next table  look at it!
zaphod was looking at it  but where? and why?
he fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses  they were a double pair of joo janta 200
super-chromatic peril sensitive sunglasses, which had been specially designed
to help people develop a relaxed attitude to danger 
the angry hitch-hiker continued to glare at his monstrously expensive fruit
juice 
worst thing that ever happened to the guide, moving to ursa minor beta,
he grumbled, theyve all gone soft  you know, ive even heard that theyve
created a whole electronically synthesized universe in one of their offices so
they can go and research stories during the day and still go to parties in the
evening 
ursa minor beta, thought zaphod  he didnt even know what the thought meant 



hello? yes? megadodo publications, home of the hitch hikers guide to the
galaxy, the most totally remarkable book in the whole of the known universe,
can i help you? said the large pink-winged insect into one of the seventy
phones lined up along the vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the
foyer of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy offices  it glared at all the grubby people cluttering up the foyer,
soiling the carpets and leaving dirty handmarks on the upholstery  it adored
working for the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy, it just wished there was
some way of keeping all the hitch-hikers away  werent they meant to be
hanging round dirty spaceports or something? it was certain that it had read
something somewhere in the book about the importance of hanging round dirty
spaceports  unfortunately most of them seemed to come and hang around in
this nice clean shiny foyer after hanging around in extremely dirty spaceports  yes, i passed on your message to mr zarni-
woop, but im afraid hes too cool to see you right now  hes on an intergalactic
cruise 
it waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who was angrily try-
ing to engage its attention 
yes, said the insect, he is in his office, but hes on an intergalactic cruise 
the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy is an indispensable companion to all
those who are keen to make sense of life in an infinitely complex and confusing30

chapter 5  in cases of major discrepancy its always reality
thats got it wrong  for instance, when the editors
of the guide were sued by the families of those who had died as a result of tak-
ing the entry on the planet traal literally (it said ravenous bugblatter beasts
often make a very good meal for visiting tourists instead of ravenous bug-
blatter beasts often make a very good meal of visiting tourists) they claimed
that the first version of the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing, sum-
moned a qualified poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth, truth
beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party was life itself for
failing to be either beautiful or true  the judges concurred, and in a moving
speech held that life itself was in contempt of court, and duly confiscated
it from all those there present before going off to enjoy a pleasant evenings
ultragolf 
zaphod beeblebrox entered the foyer 
ok, he said, wheres zarniwoop? get me zarniwoop 
excuse me, sir? said the insect icily 
zarniwoop 
look, said zaphod, im up to here with cool, ok? im so amazingly cool
you could keep a side of meat inside me for a month  now will you move before you blow it?
well, if youd let me explain, sir, said the insect tapping the most petulant
of all the tentacles at its disposal, im afraid that isnt possible right now as
mr zarniwoop is on an intergalactic cruise 
hell, thought zaphod 
when hes going to be back? he said 
back sir? hes in his office 
zaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought out in his mind 
he didnt succeed 
this cats on an intergalactic cruise  
listen, three eyes, he said, dont you try to outweird me 

31

well, just who do you think you are, honey? flounced the insect quivering
its wings in rage, zaphod beeblebrox or something?
count the heads, said zaphod in a low rasp 
you are zaphod beeblebrox? it squeaked 
yeah, said zaphod, but dont shout it out or theyll all want one 
the zaphod beeblebrox?
no, just a zaphod beeblebrox, didnt you hear i come in six packs?
the insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation 
yeah, thats right, said zaphod, i just havent stopped moving yet 
but hes on an intergalactic cruise, yeah, yeah, how do i get to him 
the newly installed sirius cybernetics corporation vertical people trans-
porters are in the far corner sir 
zaphod was turning to go 
can i ask you why you want to see mr zarniwoop?
yeah, said zaphod, who was unclear on this point himself, i told myself i
had to 
come again sir?
zaphod leaned forward, conspirationally  no sooner had i got
there that my former self, the one that operated on my brain, popped into
my head and said go see zarniwoop  that and the fact that ive got to find the man who rules the
universe 
mr beeblebrox, sir, said the insect in awed wonder, youre so weird you
should be in movies 
yeah, said zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing, and you,
baby, should be in real life 

this was not such an insect, and it couldnt stand robots 
well in that case, if youll just excuse me   the restraining metal hand fell limply by
marvins side 
hardly worth anyones while to help a menial robot is it?
im sorry, sir, if  
i mean wheres the percentage in being kind or helpful to a robot if it doesnt
have any gratitude circuits?
and you dont have any? said the insect, who didnt seem to be able to drag
itself out of this conversation 
ive never had occasion to find out, marvin informed it 
arent you going to ask me what i want?
the insect paused  want?
im looking for someone 
zaphod beeblebrox, said marvin, hes over there 
what!
pathetic isnt it?
with a grinding of gears marvin turned and trundled off  he caught up with
zaphod approaching the elevators  zaphod span round in astonishment 
i dont know, he said  an improbability field

its long thin tongue darted out and licked its eyes and

33

i expect 
oh, fine, said marvin, if you happen to like being me which personally i
dont 
yeah, yeah, said zaphod as the elevator doors opened  i have been designed by the sirius cybernetics corpora-
tion to take you, the visitor to the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy, into these
their offices  if you enjoy your ride, which will be swift and pleasurable, then
you may care to experience some of the other elevators which have recently
been installed in the offices of the galactic tax department, boobiloo baby
foods and the sirian state mental hospital, where many ex-sirius cybernet-
ics corporation executives will be delighted to welcome your visits, sympathy,
and happy tales of the outside world 
good, said zaphod, now will you take us up?
may i ask you, inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most reasonable voice,
if youve considered all the possibilities that down might offer you?
zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall  he didnt need this,
he thought to himself, this of all things he had no need of  he hadnt asked
to be here 
one thing he didnt want to be doing was chasing after the man who ruled the
universe, who was only doing a job which he might as well keep at, because if
it wasnt him it would only be someone else  most of all he didnt want to be
standing in an office block arguing with an elevator 
well, the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits, theres the basement, the
microfiles, the heating system   er  
whats the matter with the thing? he spat 
it doesnt want to go up, said marvin simply, i think its afraid 
afraid? cried zaphod, of what? heights? an elevator thats afraid of
heights?
no, said the elevator miserably, of the future  
zaphod looked out of the elevator - an agitated crowd had gathered round the
elevator area, pointing and shouting 
marvin, he said, just get this elevator go up will you? weve got to get to
zarniwoop 
why? asked marvin dolefully 
i dont know, said zaphod, but when i find him, hed better have a very
good reason for me wanting to see him 
modern elevators are strange and complex entities  the ancient electric winch
and maximum-capacity-eight-persons jobs bear as much relation to a sirius
cybernetics corporation happy vertical people transporter as a packet of
mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the sirian state mental hospital 
this is because they operate on the curios principle of defocused temporal
perception  in other words they have the capacity to see dimly into the im-
mediate future, which enables the elevator to be on the right floor to pick
you up even before you knew you wanted it, thus eliminating all the tedious
chatting, relaxing, and making friends that people were previously forced to
do whist waiting for elevators 
not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and precognition be-
came terribly frustrated with the mindless business of going up and down, up
and down, experimented briefly with the notion of going sideways, as a sort

35

of existential protest, demanded participation in the decision-making process
and finally took to squatting in basements sulking 
an impoverished hitch-hiker visiting any planets in the sirius star system these
days can pick up easy money working as a counsellor for neurotic elevators 
fifteenth, said the elevator, and remember, im only doing this because i
like your robot 
zaphod and marvin bundled out of the elevator which instantly snapped its
doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would take it 
zaphod looked around warily  the corridor was deserted and silent and gave
no clue as to where zarniwoop might be found  through a large window the brilliant sun of ursa minor
beta threw blocks of light in which danced small specks of dust  a shadow
flitted past momentarily 
you know something? said zaphod to marvin 
im dead certain this building shouldnt be shaking, zaphod said  in the
sunbeams the flecks of dust danced more vigorously  another shadow flitted
past 
zaphod looked at the floor 
either, he said, not very confidently, theyve got some vibro system for
toning up your muscles while you work, or  
he walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because at that mo-
ment his joo janta 200 super-chromatic peril sensitive sunglasses had turned
utterly black  a large shadow flitted past the window with a sharp buzz 
zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so the building shook with a
thunderous roar 
who in the galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company? asked za-
phod, but never heard marvins reply because at that moment the building
shook with another bomb attack  he tried to stagger back to the elevator - a
pointless manoeuvre he realized, but the only one he could think of 
zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the building 
no, called zaphod, beeblebrox over here! who are you?
a friend! shouted back the man  he ran towards zaphod 
oh yeah? said zaphod, anyones friend in particular, or just generally well
disposed of people?
the man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking beneath his feet like an ex-
cited blanket  he was short, stocky and weatherbeaten and his clothes looked
as if theyd been twice round the galaxy and back with him in them 
do you know, zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived, your buildings
being bombed?
the man indicated his awareness  glancing round at the window to see why,
zaphod gaped as a huge sluglike, gunmetal-green spacecraft crept through the
air past the building 
the government you deserted is out to get you, zaphod, hissed the man,
theyve sent a squadron of frogstar fighters 
frogstar fighters! muttered zaphod, zarquon!
you get the picture?
what are frogstar fighters? zaphod was sure hed heard someone talk
about them when he was president, but he never paid much attention to
official matters  with a
searing whine a small black spider-like object shot through the air and disap-
peared down the corridor 
what was that? hissed zaphod 
frogstar scout robot class a out looking for you, said the man  it zapped
past them ?
a frogstar scout robot class b out looking for you 
and that? said zaphod, as a third one seared through the air 
a frogstar scout robot class c out looking for you 
hey, chuckled zaphod to himself, pretty stupid robots eh?
from over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum 
holy photon, whats that?

37

a tank, said the man, frogstar scout robot class d come to get you 
marvin! called zaphod 
whilst you save your skins 
the man tugged at zaphods arm, and zaphod followed him off down the
corridor 
zarniwoops office  he was not in fact a particu-
larly small robot  his silver body gleamed in the dusty sunbeams and shook
with the continual barrage which the building was still undergoing 
im afraid, said marvin, that ive been left here to stop you  molecule-sized electronic relays
deep in its micro-brain flipped backwards and forwards in consternation 
zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a second
and along a third  the building continued to rock and judder and this puzzled
zaphod 
all this way, thought zaphod, all this trouble, all this not- lying-on-the-beach-
having-a-wonderful-time, and for what? a single chair, a single desk and a
single dirty ashtray in an undecorated office 
hes on an intergalactic cruise, said the man 

zaphod tried to size the man up 
hello roosta, said zaphod 
hello, towel, he added as roosta held out to him a rather nasty old flowery
towel 
outside the window, one of the huge slug-like, gunmetal-green spaceships
growled past 
yes, go on, said marvin to the huge battle machine, youll never guess 
errmmm   said the machine, vibrating with unaccustomed thought, laser
beams?
marvin shook his head solemnly  anti-
matter ray? it hazarded 
yes, grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed, er   how about an elec-
tron ram?
this was new to marvin 
whats that? he said 
from its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal blaze of light  the dust bil-
lowed briefly, then settled 
good though, isnt it?
very good, agreed marvin 
i know, said the frogstar battle machine, after another moments consid-
eration, you must have one of those new xanthic re-structron destabilized
zenon emitters!
nice, arent they? said marvin 
thats what youve got? said the machine in considerable awe 
youre thinking along the wrong lines, said marvin, youre failing to take
into account something fairly basic in the relationship between men and robots  it tailed off into thought again 
just think, urged marvin, they left me, an ordinary, menial robot, to stop

41

you, a gigantic heavy-duty battle machine, whilst they ran off to save them-
selves  what do you think they would leave me with?
oooh, er, muttered the machine in alarm, something pretty damn devas-
tating i should expect 
well, doesnt that just take the biscuit! it roared, nothing, eh? just dont
think, do they?
and me, said marvin in a soft low voice, with this terrible pain in all the
diodes down my left side 
makes you spit, doesnt it?
yes, agreed marvin with feeling 
thats very impressive, murmured marvin 
you aint seeing nothing yet, promised the machine, i can take out this
floor too, no trouble!
it took out the floor, too 
hells bells! the machine roared as it plummeted fifteen storeys and smashed
itself to bits on the ground below 



so, do we just sit here, or what? said zaphod angrily, what do these guys
out here want?
you, beeblebrox, said roosta, theyre going to take you to the frogstar -
the most totally evil world in the galaxy 
oh, yeah? said zaphod  theyll have to come and get me first 
zaphod looked, and gaped 
the grounds going away! he gasped, where are they taking the ground?
theyre taking the building, said roosta, were airborne 
out in the open air again zaphod could see the ring of dark green frogstar
fighters round the uprooted tower of the building 
zaphod shook his head in perplexity 
its not what youve done theyre worried about, said roosta, its what
youre going to do 
well dont i get a say in that?
you did, years ago  youd better hold on, were in for a fast and bumpy
journey 
if i ever meet myself, said zaphod, ill hit myself so hard i wont know
whats hit me 
marvin trudged in through the door, looked at zaphod accusingly, slumped in
a corner and switched himself off  he caught trillians eyes as she looked at him
inquiringly  scores rather a lot im afraid 
the ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the nth time 
trillian sighed and started to sort them out again 
up and down the silent corridors echoed ford prefects feet as he stalked the
ship thumping dead instruments 
why did it rock and sway?
why could he not find out where they were?
where, basically, were they?
the left-hand tower of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy offices streaked
through interstellar space at a speed never equalled either before or since by
any other office block in the universe 
in a room halfway up it, zaphod beeblebrox strode angrily 
roosta sat on the edge of the desk doing some routine towel maintenance 
hey, where did you say this building was flying to? demanded zaphod 
do they have food there? said zaphod 
food? youre going to the frogstar and youre worried about whether they
got food?
without food i may not make it to the frogstar 
out of the window, they could see nothing but the flickering light of the force
beams, and vague green streaks which were presumably the distorted shapes
of the frogstar fighters 
here, suck this, said roosta, offering zaphod his towel 
zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to leap out of his forehead
on a small spring 
its soaked in nutrients, explained roosta 
what are you, a messy eater or something? said zaphod 
the yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones have vitamin b and c
complexes, the little pink flowers contain wheatgerm extracts 
zaphod took and looked at it in amazement 
bar-b-q sauce, said roosta, for when i get sick of wheatgerm 
zaphod sniffed it doubtfully 
yes, said roosta, when ive had to suck that end i usually need to suck the
other end a bit too 
why, asked zaphod suspiciously, whats in that?
anti-depressants, said roosta 
ive gone right off this towel, you know, said zaphod handing it back 
roosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk, walked round it,
sat in the chair and put his feet up 
beeblebrox, he said, sticking his hands behind his head, have you any idea
whats going to happen to you on the frogstar?
theyre going to feed me? hazarded zaphod hopefully 
theyre going to feed you, said roosta, into the total perspective vortex!
zaphod had never heard of this 
only, said roosta, the most savage psychic torture a sentinent being can
undergo 
zaphod nodded a resigned nod 
so, he said, no food, huh?
listen! said roosta urgently, you can kill a man, destroy his body, break
his spirit, but only the total perspective vortex can annihilate a mans soul!
the treatment lasts seconds, but the effect lasts the rest of your life!
you ever had a pan galactic gargle blaster? asked zaphod sharply  they know
what youre after 
could they drop me a note and let me know as well?
you know, said roosta, you know, beeblebrox 
can he cook? said zaphod  if he could cook a good meal he wouldnt worry about the
rest of the universe 
roosta sighed heavily 
what are you doing here anyway? demanded zaphod, whats all this got
to so with you?
im just one of those who planned this thing, along with zarniwoop, along

46

chapter 7 

with yooden vranx, along with your great grandfather, along with you, bee-
blebrox  i was told you had changed, i didnt realize how much 
roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence 
zaphod was terribly glad 



the air around the second planet of the frogstar system was stale and un-
wholesome 
the howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the old decay-
ing houses of the cities; it was more desolate as it whipped about the bottoms
of the tall black towers that swayed uneasily here and there about the surface
of this world 
the howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however, when it passed over
a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain on the outskirts of
the largest of the abandoned cities 
this pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the reputation
of being the most totally evil place in the galaxy 
about a hundred yards or so away, and separated from it by a pockmarked and
blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable was what would probably
have to be described as a landing pad of sorts  that is to say that scattered
over a largish area were the ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed
buildings 
the larger speck was the left-hand tower of the hitch hikers guide to the48

chapter 8 

galaxy office building, descending through the stratosphere of frogstar world
b 
as it descended, roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable silence that
had grown up between the two men 
zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner sharing un-
spoken thoughts with marvin 
good luck, he added, and walked out of the door, disappearing from za-
phods life as mysteriously as he had entered it 
zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but roosta had already looked it 
two minutes later, the building crashlanded amongst the other wreckage  its
escort of frogstar fighters deactivated their force beams and soared off into
the air again, bound for frogstar world a, an altogether more congenial spot 
they never landed on frogstar world b 
zaphod was badly shaken by the crash  he felt bewildered, he felt lonely,
he felt unloved  with
marvins help he got the window open  outside it, the cloud of dust aroused
by the crash, and the hulks of the other buildings with which this one was
surrounded, effectively prevented zaphod from seeing anything of the world
outside  zarniwoops office was on the fifteenth floor 
the occasional remark from marvin of the order of this is the sort of thing
you lifeforms enjoy is it? i ask merely for information, did little to improve
his state of mind 
it seemed to zaphod as he lay there panting with fear and exhaustion that
marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than usual  eventually he realized this
wasnt so 
a large, scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly settling clouds
of dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs, landed on an inclined window
ledge a couple of yards from zaphod  it folded its ungainly wings and teetered
awkwardly on its perch 
its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head and neck
seemed curiously large for a bird  its face was flat, the beak underdeveloped,
and half-way along the underside of its wings the vestiges of something hand-
like could be clearly seen 
it turned its heavy eyes on zaphod and clicked its beak in a desultory fashion 
go away, said zaphod 
zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment  he was quite
prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that he was in fact hallucinat-
ing 
poor souls, said a deep, ethereal voice in zaphods ear 
twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly caused zaphod
to fall off the building 
zaphod looked wildly about  there is, however, nothing
soothing about being addressed by a disembodied voice out of nowhere, par-
ticularly if you are, like zaphod beeblebrox, not at your best and hanging from
a ledge eight storeys up a crashed building 

hey, er  
hey, who are you? panted zaphod  i am gargravarr  i am the cus-
todian of the total perspective vortex  why dont you try it?
zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves leading all the way
down the side of the building 
why dont i see you again at the bottom? said the voice in his ear, and as
it spoke it faded 
itll only take a couple of minutes  
marvin, said zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly next to
him, did a  
zaphod nodded  he took out his peril sensitive sunglasses again  he would find his way down the build-
ing more comfortably if he didnt actually have to look at what he was doing 
marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the dust and
rubble, from which position he seemed too disinclined to move 
ah, there you are, said the voice suddenly in zaphods ear, excuse me leav-
ing you like that, its just that i have a terrible head for heights 
zaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he had missed some-
thing which might be the source of the voice  all he saw, however, was the
dust, the rubble and the towering hulks of the encircling buildings 
hey, er, why cant i see you? he said, why arent you here?
i am here, said the voice slowly, my body wanted to come but its a bit
busy at the moment 
zaphod wasnt sure about this 
elbows? said zaphod, dont you mean last legs?

51

the voice said nothing for a while  zaphod looked around uneasily  he didnt
know if it was gone or was still there or what it was doing 
so, you are to be put into the vortex, yes?
er, well, said zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance, this cats
in no hurry, you know  i can just slouch about and take in a look at the local
scenery, you know?
have you seen the local scenery? asked the voice of gargravarr 
zaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner of one of the
wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view 
he looked out at the landscape of frogstar world b  it was only by listening very carefully that
zaphod was able to detect the direction from which it was coming 



the universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big place, a fact
which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to ignore 
in fact the only oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those who are hurled
out of it for the heinous crime of wondering whether any of the other trees
might be capable of supporting life at all, or indeed whether the other trees
are anything other than illusions brought on by eating too many oglanuts 
exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life form in the galaxy
which is not in some way guilty of the same thing, which is why the total
perspective vortex is as horrific as it is 
visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome 

zaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid helium 
hey, what was that? he muttered voicelessly  stammered zaphod, couldnt we maybe slope
off to a party or something for a while, think it over?
for all i know, said gargravarrs ethereal voice, im probably at one 
hey ho  its busy you know, said gargravarr hesitantly 
you mean its got a mind of its own? said zaphod 
there was a long and slightly chilly pause before gargravarr spoke again 
zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology 
no matter, said gargravarr, you werent to know 
the truth is, it continued in tones which suggested he was trying very hard
to keep it under control, the truth is that we are currently undergoing a pe-
riod of legal trial separation 
the voice was still again, leaving zaphod with no idea of what to say 
i think we are probably not very well suited, said gargravarr again at length,
we never seemed to be happy doing the same things  i pointed out that in fact i was meant to inhibit it,
and it said that that was exactly the sort of smart alec remark that got right
up a bodys left nostril, and so we left it  it will probably get custody of my
forename  said zaphod faintly, and whats that?
pizpot, said the voice, my name is pizpot gargravarr  says it all really
doesnt it?
errr   said zaphod sympathetically 

55

except the victims of the vortex - they dont really count im afraid  would you like to hear it?
er  
its a well known
economic phenomenon but tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe
shops there were, the more shoes they had to make and the worse and more
unwearable they became  those few who had the right kind of genetic instability mutated into
birds - youve seen one of them - who cursed their feet, cursed the ground, and
vowed that none should walk on it again 
zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward across the plain 
and you, he said, you come from this hellhole pit do you?
no no, said gargravarr, taken aback, i come from the frogstar world c  i flit back there in the evenings 
at that moment another dismal scream rent the air and zaphod shuddered 
the universe, said gargravarr simply, the whole infinite universe 
hey, im zaphod beeblebrox, man, you know, muttered zaphod trying to
flap the last remnants of his ego 
gargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming till they
reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the plain 
as they reached it, a door hummed open in the side, revealing a small dark-
ened chamber within 
enter, said gargravarr 
zaphod started with fear 
zaphod peered nervously inside  er   it doesnt look like any kind of vortex to me, said zaphod 
with infinite trepidation zaphod stepped into it  he was aware of gargravarr
being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied man was not for the
moment speaking 
i must get myself into the right frame of mind for this, muttered zaphod 
there is no right frame of mind, said gargravarr sternly 
i dont 
at the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the elevator opened up and zaphod
stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel-lined chamber 
is that it? said zaphod in surprise 
didnt look too bad, thought zaphod 
and i get in there do i? said zaphod 
you get in there, said gargravarr, and im afraid you must do it now 
ok, ok, said zaphod 
to explain - since every piece of matter in the universe is in some way affected
by every other piece of matter in the universe, it is in theory possible to ex-
trapolate the whole of creation - every sun, every planet, their orbits, their
composition and their economic and social history from, say, one small piece
of fairy cake 
trin tragula - for that was his name - was a dreamer, a thinker, a speculative
philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an idiot 
and she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate amount of
time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over the mechanics of safety
pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces of fairy cake 
to trin tragulas horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain; but to
his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going
to exist in a universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have
is a sense of proportion 
from his disembodied mind gargravarr watched dejectedly  he had rather
liked zaphod beeblebrox in a strange sort of way  he was clearly a man of58

chapter 10 
he waited for him to flop forwards out of the box, as they all did 
beeblebrox   gasped gargravarrs mind in amazement 
could i have a drink please? said zaphod  have been in the vortex? stammered gargravarr  really neat place, you know that?
gargravarrs mind was reeling in astonishment  what did you experience?
zaphod shrugged smugly  im a really terrific and great guy 
didnt i tell you, baby, im zaphod beeblebrox!
his gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and suddenly
stopped, startled 
hey, he said, is that really a piece of fairy cake?
he ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with which it was
surrounded 
if i told you how much i needed this, he said ravenously, i wouldnt have
time to eat it  having a conceited ego is one thing 
he didnt have time to reflect on this matter 
gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters as to what
had happened, but that he was prepared to leave a decent interval before doing
so  enough time for zaphod to make a break and find somewhere to hide 
what he was going to do he didnt know, but feeling that he was the most
important person in the universe gave him the confidence to believe that some-
thing would turn up 
nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds for opti-
mism  the buildings he passed were so crumbled and
decrepit he thought it unsafe to enter any of them 
after a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from the one down
which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low building, surrounded with
sundry smaller ones, the whole surrounded by the remains of a perimeter bar-
rier  the large main building still seemed reasonably solid, and zaphod turned60

chapter 11  along one side of it - the front it would seem
since it faced a wide concreted apron area - were three gigantic doors, maybe
sixty feet high  the far one of these was open, and towards this, zaphod ran 
part of the infrastructure of the building had collapsed, part of the rear wall
had caved in, and a thick choking dust lay inches over the floor 
zaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks  zaphod approached it with interest, and as he did
so, he tripped over an old feedline 
he tried to toss the feedline aside, and to his surprise discovered that it was
still connected to the ship 
to his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also humming
slightly 
he stared at the ship in disbelief, and then back down at the feedline in his
hands  crawling along on his hands and
knees he followed the feedline to the point where it connected with the ship 
the connection was sound, and the slight humming vibration was more dis-
tinct  he wiped away some grime and laid an ear against
the ships side 
he rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all about him
and found a short length of tubing, and a non- biodegradable plastic cup 
the voice said:
transtellar cruise lines would like to apologize to passengers for the contin-
uing delay to this flight  we are currently awaiting the loading of our comple-
ment of small lemon-soaked paper napkins for your comfort, refreshment and

61

hygiene during the journey 
zaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship 
he walked around for a few moments in a daze 
zaphods eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some brief calcula-
tions 
please return to your seat sir, said the android stewardess and, turning her
back on him, she walked on down the corridor in front of him 
they were now in the passenger compartment and zaphods heart stopped
still again for a moment 
zaphod had the creeping horrors 
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, she said sweetly, thank you for bear-
ing with us during this slight delay 

till zaphod thought his ears would shatter 
he turned and looked at zaphod 
zaphods skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying to get off  he leant back against the door breathing hard  this is your
autopilot speaking 
zaphod said nothing 
please return to your seat, repeated the autopilot  passengers are not al-
lowed on the flight deck 
im not a passenger, panted zaphod 
i am not a passenger! shouted zaphod again 
youre the autopilot? said zaphod 
yes, said the voice from the flight console 
youre in charge of this ship?
yes, said the voice again, there has been a delay 
zaphod moved away from the door, on which the pounding had now ceased 
he approached the flight console  there are no lemon-soaked
paper napkins on the way from anywhere!
the statistical likelihood, continued the autopilot primly, is that other civ-
ilizations will arise  zaphod span round to see the man who
had pursued him standing there 
zaphod beeblebrox, he said, my name is zarniwoop 
zaphod beeblebrox wittered 
ive been waiting here for you, he said in a businesslike tone 
zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled 
when you entered the door of my office, you entered my electronically syn-
thesized universe, he explained, if you had left by the door you would have
been back in the real one 
he patted the briefcase smugly 
zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing 
whats the difference? he muttered  oh - except that i think the
frogstar fighters are grey in the real universe 
whats going on? spat zaphod 
simple, said zarniwoop  his self assurance and smugness made zaphod
seethe 
very simple, repeated zarniwoop, i discovered the coordinated at which
this man could be found - the man who rules the universe, and discovered
that his world was protected by an unprobability field 
you and i? said zaphod angrily, you mean i knew you?
yes, said zarniwoop, we knew each other well 
i had no taste, said zaphod and resumed a sullen silence 

meanwhile, you and i arranged that you would steal the improbability drive
ship - the only one which could reach the rulers world - and bring it to me
here  he smiled a
tight little smile which zaphod wanted to hit with a brick  shall
we go?
where? said zaphod sullenly 
where is your jacket?
zaphod looked at him in mystification 
zarniwoop stood up and gestured to zaphod to follow him 
out in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of the pas-
sengers being fed coffee and biscuits 
it has not been a pleasant experience waiting for you, said zarniwoop 
zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung open  a few feet
away from them they could see zaphods jacket lying in the debris 
the small metal model of the heart of gold that zaphod had been bewildered
to discover in his pocket was growing 
at an improbability level, said zarniwoop, of   oh i dont know, but
something very large 
zaphod swayed 
you mean i had it with me all the time?
zarniwoop smiled 
goodbye artificial universe, he said, hello real one!
the scene before them shimmered briefly - and reappeared exactly as before 
you mean, repeated zaphod tautly, that i had it with me all the time?
oh yes, said zarniwoop, of course 
thats it, said zaphod, you can count me out, from hereon in you can count

me out  ive had all i want of this 
im afraid you cannot leave, said zarniwoop, you are entwined in the im-
probability field 
he smiled the smile that zaphod had wanted to hit and this time zaphod hit it 



ford prefect bounded up to the bridge of the heart of gold 
trillian! arthur! he shouted, its working! the ships reactivated!
trillian and arthur were asleep on the floor 
frogstar world b, and man its a dump, said zaphod running on to the
bridge, hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me you dont even
find words to tell me what a cool frood i am 
i know how you feel, said zaphod, im so great even i get tongue-tied talk-
ing to myself  hey its good to see you trillian, ford, monkeyman ?
hi there, mr beeblebrox sir, sure is a great honor to  
sure thing, fella, where do you want to go?
anywhere, doesnt matter, shouted zaphod, yes it does! he said again,
we want to go to the nearest place to eat!
sure thing, said the computer happily and a massive explosion rocket the
bridge 
when zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye, he regarded
the four wisps of smoke with interest  consciousness had died,
cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the pit of unbeing 
after what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying on a cold
hard shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of life, the universe, and
everything 
cold spasms shook them, lights danced sickeningly around them 
good evening, madam, gentlemen, it said, do you have a reservation?
ford prefects consciousness snapped back like elastic, making his brain smart 
he looked up woozily at the green blur 
arthur dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one grapples with
a lost bar of soap in the bath 
well i assume so, said ford prefect trying to work out which way was up 
i mean, he said, swaying gently, theres no way we could have survived that70

chapter 13  he had raised himself on to his elbows but it didnt
seem to improve things 
a dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor  it was zaphod beeblebrox
attempting to speak  i certainly didnt survive, he gurgled, i was a total
goner  wham bang and that was it 
yeah, thanks to you, said ford, we didnt stand a chance 
yeah, said zaphod struggling noisily to his feet 
kerpow, splat, continued zaphod, instantaneously zonked into our compo-
nent molecules  hey, ford, he said, identifying one of the slowly solidifying
blurs around him, did you get that thing of your whole life flashing before
you?
you got that too? said ford, your whole life?
yeah, said zaphod, at least i assume it was mine 
so here we are, said zaphod hesitantly, lying dead  
standing, trillian corrected him 
here we are, continued zaphod doggedly, standing dead in this desolate
  said trillian 
restaurant, concluded zaphod 
odd isnt it? said ford 
nice chandeliers though, said trillian 
they looked about themselves in bemusement 
its not so much an afterlife, said arthur, more a sort of apres vie 
the chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and the low vaulted ceil-
ing from which they hung would not, in an ideal universe, have been painted

71

in that particular shade of deep turquoise, and even if it had been it wouldnt
have been highlighted by concealed moodlighting  the fronting for the eighty-yard long
marble-topped bar had been made by stitching together nearly twenty thou-
sand antarean mosaic lizard skins, despite the fact that the twenty thousand
lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in  a young vlhurg officer and his green steaming young
lady passed through the large smoked glass doors at the far end of the bar into
the dazzling light of the main body of the restaurant beyond 
an attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place 
zaphods eyes flashed 
he said, i said it was a sort of apres  
yeah, and dont you wish you hadnt? said zaphod, ford?
i said it was odd 
perhaps, interrupted the green blur who had by this time resolved into the
shape of a small wizened dark-suited green waiter, perhaps you would care
to discuss the matter over drinks  
drinks! cried zaphod, that was it! see what you miss if you dont stay
alert 
dinner! zaphod exclaimed with passion, listen, little green person, my
stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night for the mere idea  and the universe, concluded the waiter, determined not to be deflected
on his home stretch, will explode later for your pleasure 

fords head swivelled towards him 
time journey? said zaphod 
time journey? said trillian 
you mean this isnt the afterlife? said arthur  he had almost exhausted his
polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be slipping into his role of a
rather tight lipped and sarcastic little waiter 
afterlife sir? he said, no sir 
in an extraordinary gesture which is pointless attempting to describe, zaphod
beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two of his arms and one of his
thighs with the other  he didnt
need to do this since his body was supplied with the peculiar assortment of
gases it required for survival from a small intravenous device strapped to his
leg 
zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over to the bar and bought most
of it  there is no problem involved in
becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and well-adjusted
family cant cope with  there is also no problem about changing the course
of history - the course of history does not change because it all fits together
like a jigsaw 
the major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main work to con-
sult in this matter is dr dan streetmentioners time travellers handbook of
1001 tense formations  the event will be described
differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint
of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the
further past and is further complicated by the possibility of conducting con-
versations whilst you are actually travelling from one time to another with the
intention of becoming your own father or mother 
most readers get as far as the future semi-conditionally modified subinverted
plagal past subjunctive intentional before giving up: and in fact in later edi-
tions of the book all the pages beyond this point have been left blank to save
on printing costs 
the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of aca-
demic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term future perfect has
been abandoned since it was discovered not to be 
in it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat (willan on-eat)
sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen) the whole of creation ex-
plode around them 
you can arrive (mayan arivan on-when) for any sitting you like without prior
(late fore-when) reservation because you can book retrospectively, as it were
when you return to your own time  (you can have on-book haventa forewhen
presooning returningwenta retrohome 
at the restaurant you can meet and dine with (mayan meetan con with dinan
on when) a fascinating cross-section of the entire population of space and time 
you can visit it as many times as you like (mayan on-visit re- onvisiting   and
so on - for further tense-corrections consult dr streetmentioners book) and
be sure of never meeting yourself, because of the embarrassment this usually
causes 
this, even if the rest were true, which it isnt, is patently impossible, say the
doubters 
this, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane, which is why
the advertising executives of the star system of bastablon came up with this
slogan: if youve done six impossible things this morning, why not round it
off with breakfast at milliways, the restaurant at the end of the universe?



at the bar, zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt  his heads knocked
together and his smiles were coming out of synch 
zaphod, said ford, whilst youre still capable of speech, would you care to
tell me what the photon happened? where have you been? where have we
been? small matter, but id like it cleared up 
zaphods left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink further into the obscu-
rity of drink 
yeah, he said, ive been around  they want me to find the man who rules
the universe, but i dont care to meet him 
ford had another pan galactic gargle blaster, the drink which has been de-
scribed as the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging - expensive and bad for the
head  whatever had happened, ford decided, he didnt really care too much 
listen ford, said zaphod, everythings cool and froody 
you mean everythings under control 
no, said zaphod, i do not mean everythings under control  that would
not be cool and froody 
zaphod giggled into his drink 
a wild-skinned sky-gypsy approached them and played electric violin at them
until zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed to go away again 
the gypsy approached arthur and trillian sitting in another part of the bar 
i dont know what this place is, said arthur, but i think it gives me the
creeps 

it frothed up over the side of the glass and76

chapter 15 
poor arthur, youre not really cut out for this life are you?
you call this life?
youre beginning to sound like marvin 
marvins the clearest thinker i know 
seen from the outside, which it never is, the restaurant resembles a giant glit-
tering starfish beached on a forgotten rock  each of its arms houses the bars,
the kitchens, the forcefield generators which protect the entire structure and
the decayed planet on which it sits, and the time turbines which slowly rock
the whole affair backwards and forwards across the crucial moment 
in the centre sits the gigantic golden dome, almost a complete globe, and it
was into this area that zaphod, ford, arthur and trillian now passed  the other surfaces were not available because they
were already encrusted with jewels, precious sea shells from santraginus, gold
leaf, mosaic tiles, lizard skins and a million unidentifiable embellishments and
decorations  glass glittered, silver shone, gold gleamed, arthur dent goggled 
wowee, said zaphod, zappo  !
the things, said ford prefect quietly, are also people  ! said trillian  ! said trillian 
the waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs 
the end of the universe is very popular, said zaphod threading his way
unsteadily through the throng of tables, some made of marble, some of rich
ultra-mahagony, some even of platinum, and at each a party of exotic creatures
chatting amongst themselves and studying menus 
people like to dress up for it, continued zaphod, gives it a sense of occa-
sion 
the tables were fanned out in a large circle around a central stage area where
a small band were playing light music, at least a thousand tables was arthurs
guess, and interspersed amongst them were swaying palms, hissing fountains,
grotesque statuary, in short all the paraphernalia common to all restaurants
where little expense has been spared to give the impression that no expense
has been spared  arthur glanced around, half expecting to see someone mak-

77

ing an american express commercial 
zaphod lurched into ford, who lurched back into zaphod 
wowee, said zaphod 
my great granddaddy must have really screwed up the computers works, you
know, said zaphod, i told it to take us to the nearest place to eat and it
sends us to the end of the universe 
hey, everybodys here you know 
at the end of the universe you have to use the past tense a lot, said zaphod,
cos everythings been done you know  hi, guys, he called out to a nearby
party of giant iguana lifeforms, how did you do?
is that zaphod beeblebrox? asked one iguana of another iguana 
i think so, replied the second iguana 
well doesnt that just take the biscuit, said the first iguana 
funny old thing, life, said the second iguana 
theres an old mate of mine, he said, hotblack desiato! see the man at
the platinum table with the platinum suit on?
zaphod tried to follow fords finger with his eyes but it made him feel dizzy 
whos he supposed to be? asked trillian 
hotblack desiato? said zaphod in astonishment, you dont know? you
never heard of disaster area?
no, said trillian, who hadnt  suggested zaphod  history itself, said zaphod 
no, said trillian 
zowee, said zaphod, here we are at the end of the universe and you havent
even lived yet 
hey, er, hotblack, he called out, how you doing? great to see you big
boy, hows the noise? youre looking great, really very, very fat and unwell  he slapped the man on the back and was mildly surprised that it
seemed to elict no response  the pan galactic gargle blasters swirling round
inside him told him to plunge on regardless 
remember the old days? he said, we used to hang out, right? the bistro
illegal, remember? slims throat emporium? the evildrome boozarama,
great days eh?
hotblack desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great days or
not 
and when we were hungry wed pose as public health inspectors, you remem-
ber that? and go around confiscating meals and drinks right? till we got food
poisoning  oh, and then there were the long nights of talking and drinking
in those smelly rooms above the cafe lou in gretchen town, new betel, and
you were always in the next room trying to write songs on your ajuitar and
we all hated them  and you said you didnt care, and we said we did because
we hated them so much 
and you said you didnt want to be a star, he continued, wallowing in nos-
talgia, because you despised the star system  and we said, hadra and sulijoo
and me, that we didnt think you had the option 
here, he said, is a man who buys star systems!
hotblack desiato made no attempt either to confirm or deny this fact, and
the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly 
i think someones drunk, muttered a purple bush-like being into his wine
glass 
ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing hotblack
desiato 
whats that number you do? he said, unwisely grabbing at a bottle for
support and tipping it over - into a nearby glass as it happened 
ship! sun! wham bang! he cried  i mean forget lasers and stuff, you guys

79

are into solar flares and real sunburn! oh, and terrible songs 
his eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle on to the table  it began to sink into his squelching mind
that something was missing from this reunion, and that the missing something
was in some way connected with the fact that the fat man sitting opposite
him in the platinum suit and the silvery trilby had not yet said hi, ford or
great to see you after all this time, or in fact anything at all 
he slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to see if he could spot the
owner of this discourteous hand  the face had the texture of an orange and
the colour of an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended 
er, yeah? said ford conversationally  he staggered back to his feet again
and was disappointed that the top of his head didnt come further up the mans
body  he wasnt used to being asked this
sort of question 
im the guy whos telling you to beat it, he said, before you get it beaten
for you 
now listen, said ford nervously - he wished his head would stop spinning,
settle down and get to grips with the situation - now listen, he continued,
i am one of hotblacks oldest friends and  
he glanced at hotblack desiato, who still hadnt moved so much as an eyelash 
and i am mr desiatos bodyguard, it went, and i am responsible for his
body, and i am not responsible for yours, so take it away before it gets dam-
aged 
no minutes! boomed the bodyguard, no waiting! mr desiato speaks to no
one!
well perhaps youd let him say what he thinks about the matter himself,
said ford 
ford glanced anxiously at hotblack again and was forced to admit to himself
that the bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his side 
why? said ford, whats the matter with him?
the bodyguard told him 



the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy notes that disaster area, a plutonium
rock band from the gagrakacka mind zones, are generally held to be not only
the loudest rock band in the galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind
at all  regular concert goers judge that the best sound balance is usually to
be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the
stage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote con-
trol from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the
planet - or more frequently around a completely different planet 
many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for artistic
reasons, but most commonly because the bands public address system con-
travenes local strategic arms limitations treaties 
this has not, however, stopped their earnings from pushing back the bound-
aries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research accountant has re-
cently been appointed professor of neomathematics at the university of maximega-
lon, in recognition of both his general and his special theories of disaster area
tax returns, in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space- time con-
tinuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent 
ford staggered back to the table where zaphod, arthur and trillian were sit-
ting waiting for the fun to begin 
whatd he say?
well, not a lot really  hes   er  

yeah?
hes spending a year dead for tax reasons  ive got to sit down 
huh? said trillian 
thats cool, said zaphod, well meet the meat  they lay
lightly along the folds of the curtain and gave the impression that if he didnt
watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of their own accord and do
something unspeakable in a corner  he prowled around his small cham-
ber like a mantis contemplating an evenings preying, finally settling on a
rickety chair by a trestle table, where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes  he waved to his particular friends in the audience even though
there werent any there, and waited for the applause to die down  so, welcome one and all to
milliways, the restaurant at the end of the universe!
with a gesture he deftly conjured another round of spontaneous applause 
i am your host for tonight, he said, my name is max quordlepleen  
(everybody knew this, his act was famous throughout the known galaxy, but
he said it for the fresh applause it generated, which he acknowledged with a
disclaiming smile and wave  and ive just come straight from the very
very other end of time, where ive been hosting a show at the big bang burger
bar - where i can tell you we had a very exciting evening ladies and gentlemen
- and i will be with you right through this historic occasion, the end of history
itself!
another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights dimmed down fur-
ther  on every table candles ignited themselves spontaneously, eliciting a slight
gasp from all the diners and wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights
and a million intimate shadows 
maxs voice was hushed as he continued 
so, ladies and gentlemen, he breathed, the candles are lit, the band plays
softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us fades into transparency, reveal-
ing a dark and sullen sky hung heavy with the ancient light of livid swollen
stars, i can see were all in for a fabulous evenings apocalypse!
even the soft tootling of the band faded away as stunned shock descended on
all those who had not seen this sight before 
a monstrous, grisly light poured in on them,
- a hideous light,
- a boiling, pestilential light,
- a light that would have disfigured hell 
thank you, ladies and gentlemen, cried max, ill be back with you again

84

chapter 16 

in just a moment, and meanwhile i leave you in the very capable hands of mr
reg nullify and his cataclysmic combo  big hand please ladies and gentlemen
for reg and the boys!
the baleful turmoil of the skies continued 
hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a moment or so normal conver-
sation resumed  max began his round of the tables, swapping jokes, shouting
with laughter, earning his living 
a large dairy animal approached zaphod beeblebroxs table, a large fat meaty
quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small horns and what
might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips 
good evening, it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, i am the main
dish of the day  may i interest you in parts of my body? it harrumphed and
gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters into a more comfortable position and
gazed peacefully at them 
its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from arthur and trillian, a
resigned shrug from ford prefect and naked hunger from zaphod beeblebrox 
something off the shoulder perhaps? suggested the animal, braised in a
white wine sauce?
er, your shoulder? said arthur in a horrified whisper 
but naturally my shoulder, sir, mooed the animal contentedly, nobody
elses is mine to offer 
zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the animals shoulder
appreciatively  ive been exercising it
and eating plenty of grain, so theres a lot of good meat there  it gave a
mellow grunt, gurgled again and started to chew the cud 
or a casserole of me perhaps? it added 
you mean this animal actually wants us to eat it? whispered trillian to
ford 
me? said ford, with a glazed look in his eyes, i dont mean anything 
thats absolutely horrible, exclaimed arthur, the most revolting thing ive
ever heard 
whats the problem earthman? said zaphod, now transferring his attention
to the animals enormous rump 
i just dont want to eat an animal thats standing here inviting me to, said
arthur, its heartless 
better than eating an animal that doesnt want to be eaten, said zaphod 
thats not the point, arthur protested  then he thought about it for a mo-
ment  i dont care, im not going

85

to think about it now  er  
may i urge you to consider my liver? asked the animal, it must be very
rich and tender by now, ive been force-feeding myself for months 
are you going to tell me, said arthur, that i shouldnt have green salad?
well, said the animal, i know many vegetables that are very clear on that
point  which is why it was eventually decided to cut through the whole tan-
gled problem and breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten and was
capable of saying so clearly and distinctly 
look, said zaphod, we want to eat, we dont want to make a meal of the
issues  we havent eaten in five hundred
and seventy-six thousand million years 
dont worry, sir, he said, ill be very humane 
it waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen 
zaphod and ford wolfed straight into them without a seconds hesitation  tril-
lian paused, then shrugged and started into hers 
hey, earthman, said zaphod with a malicious grin on the face that wasnt
stuffing itself, whats eating you?
and the band played on  the air was
filled with talk of this and that, and with the mingled scents of exotic plants,
extravagant foods and insidious wines  for an infinite number of miles in ev-
ery direction the universal cataclysm was gathering to a stupefying climax 
and now, ladies and gentlemen, he beamed, is everyone having one last
wonderful time?
yes, called out the sort of people who call out yes when comedians ask
them if theyre having a wonderful time 
thats wonderful, enthused max, absolutely wonderful  and as the photon

86

chapter 16 

storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing to tear apart the last
of the red hot suns, i know youre all going to settle back and enjoy with me
what i know we will find all an immensely exciting and terminal experience 
believe me, ladies and gentlemen, he said, theres nothing penultimate
about this one  all there was was the endless repetition of the
final moment, as the restaurant rocked slowly forward over the brink of times
furthest edge - and back again  except of course for the sweet trolley, and a fine selection of alde-
baran liqueurs!
the band gave him a musical sting  he wished they wouldnt, he didnt need
it, not an artist of his calibre 
and for once, he cried cheerily, you dont need to worry about having a
hangover in the morning - because there wont be any more mornings!
he beamed at his happy, laughing audience  he glanced up at the sky, going
through the same dead routine every night, but his glance was only for a frac-
tion of a second 
and now, he said, strutting about the stage, at the risk of putting a damper
on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here this evening, i would like to
welcome a few parties  he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, do we have a
party here from the zansellquasure flamarion bridge club from beyond the
vortvoid of qvarne? are they here?
a rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear 

87

are they here? he asked again, to elict a louder cheer  lightning arced across the stage  max gave them a very thin
lipped smile 
and thirdly, he said, thirdly a party of young conservatives from sirius b,
are they here?
a party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing rolls at each other
and started throwing rolls at the stage  they yapped and barked unintelligi-
bly 
yes, said max, well this is all your fault, you realize that?
and finally, said max, quieting the audience down and putting on his solemn
face, finally i believe we have with us here tonight, a party of believers, very
devout believers, from the church of the second coming of the great prophet
zarquon 
there were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of the floor,
ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously, and staying apart from
the festivities  they blinked resentfully as the spotlight was turned on them  he said hed come again,
and hes kept you waiting a long time, so lets hope hes hurrying fellas, be-
cause hes only got eight minutes left!
the party of zarquons followers sat rigid, refusing to be buffeted by the waves
of uncharitable laughter which swept over them 
no, but seriously though folks, seriously though, no offence meant  no, i
know we shouldnt make fun of deeply held beliefs, so i think a big hand
please for the great prophet zarquon   wherever hes got to!
he blew a kiss to the stony-faced party and returned to the centre of the stage 

in other words a

its marvellous though, he rattled on, to see so many of you here tonight -
no isnt it though? yes, absolutely marvellous  it really gives one hope for the future
of all lifekind  except of course, he waved at the blitzing turmoil above and
around them, that we know it hasnt got one  
arthur turned to ford - he hadnt quite got this place worked out in his mind  dont we go with
it?
ford gave him a three-pan-galactic-gargle-blaster look,
rather unsteady one  he turned his attention back to a bowl of soup hed man-
aged to get from the waiter to replace his steak 
look, he said again, imagine this napkin, right, as the temporal universe,
right? and this spoon as a transductional mode in the matter curve  
thats the spoon i was eating with, he said 
hey would you let go of my fork? snapped zaphod 
alright, said ford, alright, alright  why dont we say   why dont we say
that this wine glass is the temporal universe  
what, the one youve just knocked on the floor?
did i do that?
yes  i mean, look, do you know - do
you know how the universe actually began for a kick off?
probably not, said arthur, who wished hed never embarked on any of this 
where from? said arthur, harrods was destroyed by the vogons 
doesnt matter 

89

listen 
alright 
you get this bath, see? imagine youve got this bath  and
its conical  its conical 
doesnt matter  sugars fine  are
you listening?
im listening 
you pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls away you see, out of
the plughole 
you dont see  you dont see at all  i havent got to the clever bit yet 
thats not the clever bit  so then, you just sit
and watch it, and everything just appears to spiral upwards out of the plughole
and fill the bath  see?
and thats how the universe began is it? said arthur 
no, said ford, but its a marvellous way to relax 
wheres my wine glass? he said 
ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because he was ex-
tremely drunk 
the waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly understood 

mr zaphod beeblebrox? inquired the waiter  the other dawdled lovingly over the food it was still
shovelling in 
there were now so many people after him hed lost count  he shouldnt have
made such a conspicuous entrance  how
do you know youre having fun if theres no one watching you have it?
maybe someone here tipped off the galactic police, said trillian 
im a pretty dangerous dude when im concerned 
hey, what is this, judgment day? snapped zaphod 
im in no hurry, muttered zaphod, ok, so whos the cat on the phone?
he kicked ford  it seems you left here somewhat precipitately 
zaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other 
youre saying, he said, that before we arrived here, we left here?
this is going to be a long night, thought the waiter 
put your analyst on danger money, baby, advised zaphod 

91

no, wait a minute, said ford, emerging above table level again, where ex-
actly is here?
to be absolutely exact sir, it is frogstar world b 
oh, said arthur brightly, you mean weve travelled in time but not in
space 
go bang your heads together four-eyes, he advised zaphod 
arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite, or indeed coherent  i believe five hundred and seventy-six thousand mil-
lion years whilst staying in exactly the same place, explained the waiter 
thats it! said zaphod, i got it  i told the computer to send us to the
nearest place to eat, thats exactly what it did 
but who, said zaphod, is the cat on the phone?
whatever happened to marvin? said trillian 
zaphod clapped his hands to his heads 
the paranoid android! i left him moping about on frogstar b  shee, you guys are
so unhip its a wonder your bums dont fall off 
hey, marvin, is that you? said zaphod into the phone, how you doing,
kid?
there was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line 
i think you ought to know im feeling very depressed, it said 
zaphod cupped his hands over the phone  food,
wine, a little personal abuse and the universe going foom 
you dont have to pretend to be interested in me you know, said marvin at
last, i know perfectly well im only a menial robot 
ok, ok, said zaphod, but where are you?
reverse primary thrust, marvin, thats what they say to me, open airlock
number three, marvin 
yeah, yeah, sympathized zaphod hardly at all 
but im quite used to being humiliated, droned marvin, i can even go and
stick my head in a bucket of water if you like  would you like me to go and
stick my head in a bucket of water? ive got one ready  sad little clunks
and gurgles came up the line 
whats he saying? asked trillian 
yeah, yeah, said zaphod, now will you please tell us where you are?
im in the car park, said marvin 
in one movement zaphod leapt to his feet, threw down the phone and wrote
hotblack desiato on the bill 
come on guys, he said, marvins in the car park 
whats he doing in the car park? asked arthur 
parking cars, what else? dum dum 
ive seen it  its rubbish, said zaphod, nothing but a gnab gib  come on, lets get zappy 
few of the other diners paid them any attention as they weaved their way
through the restaurant to the exit  their eyes were riveted on the horror of
the skies 
an interesting effect to watch for, max was telling them, is in the upper
left-hand quadrant of the sky, where if you look very carefully you can see the

star system hastromil boiling away into the ultra-violet 



the main reception foyer was almost empty but ford nevertheless weaved his
way through it 
zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred him into a cubicle
standing to one side of the entrance hall 
sobering him up, said zaphod and pushed a coin into a slot 
yeah, but ive cooled on that ship  zarniwoop can have it  i dont want to
play his games 
a sirius cybernetics corporation happy vertical people transporter took
them down deep into the substrata beneath the restaurant  they were glad
to see it had been vandalized and didnt try to make them happy as well as
take them down 
the first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete wall with over
fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for all of fifty major lifeforms 
they turned a corner and found themselves on a moving catwalk that traversed
a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the dim distance 
it was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship belonging
to one of the diners upstairs, some smallish and utilitarian mass production
models, others vast shining limoships, the playthings of the very rich 

zaphods eyes sparkled with something that may or may not have been avarice
as he passed over them  dimly they could see a small metal figure
listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner of a giant silver suncruiser  zaphod stepped off the catwalk into one and floated gently
downwards 
hey, marvin, said zaphod striding over towards to him, hey, kid, are we
pleased to see you 
no youre not, he said, no one ever is 
suit yourself, said zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships 
only trillian and arthur actually went up to marvin 
no, really we are, said trillian and patted him in a way that he disliked
intensely, hanging around waiting for us all this time 
well, here we are now, said trillian, felling - quite correctly in marvins view
- that it was a slightly foolish thing to say  the third million years i didnt enjoy
at all 
trillian cleared her throat 
the best conversation i had was over forty million years ago, continued mar-
vin 
thats a  

97

you dont like talking to me do you? said marvin in a low desolate tone 
trillian talked to arthur instead 
further down the chamber ford prefect had found something of which he very
much liked the look, several such things in fact 
zaphod, he said in a quiet voice, just look at some of these little star trol-
leys  
zaphod looked and liked  it resembled nothing
so much as a paper dart about twenty feet long made of thin but tough metal
foil 
the heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons and was contained
within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic field situated half-way along
the length of the ship, and this heat-sink enabled the craft to be manoeuvred
to within a few miles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the solar flares
that burst out from its surface  it is also of course stupefyingly dangerous - those who dont die riding
invariably die of sexual exhaustion at one of the daedalus clubs apres- flare
parties 
ford and zaphod looked and passed on 
and this baby, said ford, the tangerine star buggy with the black sun-
busters  
again, the star buggy was a small ship - a totally misnamed one in fact, be-
cause the one thing it couldnt manage was interstellar distances  basically
it was a sporty planet hopper dolled up to something it wasnt 
the next one was a big one and thirty yards long - a coach built limoship and
obviously designed with one aim in mind, that of making the beholder sick
with envy  the paintwork and accessory detail clearly said not only am i
rich enough to afford this ship, i am also rich enough not to take it seriously 
just look at it, said zaphod, multi-cluster quark drive, perspulex running
boards  got to be a lazlar lyricon custom job 
yes, he said, look, the infra-pink lizard emblem on the neutrino cowling 
lazlars trade mark 

i was passed by one of these mothers once, out by the axel nebula, said
ford, i was going flat out and this thing just strolled past me, star drive
hardly ticking over 
zaphod whistled appreciatively 
ten seconds later, said ford, it smashed straight into the third moon of
jaglan beta 
hey, come and see, he called out, theres a big mural painted on this side  this must be hotblacks ship 
lucky old bugger  they do this terrible song you know which ends with a
stuntship crashing into the sun 
zaphods attention however was elsewhere  his attention was riveted on the
ship standing next to hotblack desiatos limo 
light just seems to fall into it!
zaphod said nothing 
zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a man possessed - or more accurately
like a man who wanted to possess 
see? said zaphod, its just totally frictionless  this must be one mother of
a mover   er  
but were going to, arent we?
how can we not?
they gazed a little longer, till zaphod suddenly pulled himself together 
yeah?
how do we do it?
simple, said zaphod 
come on over here, said zaphod, weve got a job for you 
yes you will, enthused zaphod, theres a whole new life stretching out ahead
of you 
will you shut up and listen! hissed zaphod, this time theres going to be
excitement and adventure and really wild things 
marvin! all im trying to ask you  
i suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?
what? er   yeah, thats right, said zaphod jumpily 
well i wish youd just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm, said
marvin, because i havent got one 
ford and zaphod stared at the opening 
dont mention it, said marvin, oh, you didnt 
arthur and trillian clustered round 
whats happening? asked arthur 
weirder and weirder, breathed zaphod 
in the restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment after which there
wouldnt be any more moments 

all eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of hotblack desiatos body-
guard, which were looking intently at hotblack desiato, and those of hotblack
desiato himself which the bodyguard had closed out of respect  had hotblack desiato been
alive, he probably would have deemed this a good moment to lean back, or
even go for a short walk  on account of his unfortunate condition, however, hotblack desi-
ato remained totally inert 
mr desiato, sir? whispered the bodyguard 
mr desiato? can you hear me?
hotblack desiato, quit naturally, said nothing 
again, quite naturally, hotblack desiato did not reply 
its time we get going, mr desiato, muttered the bodyguard, dont want
to get caught in the rush, not in your condition 
kakrafoon  the bodyguard would have given dr dan streetmentioner
an apoplectic attack  if we get on down there, ill set the black ship au-
topilot and well cruise off in the limo 
the bodyguard wheeled hotblack desiatos chair out of the restaurant 
and now, cried max from the centre of the stage, the moment youve all
been waiting for! he flung his arms into the air  behind him, the band went
into a frenzy of percussion and rolling synthochords  max had argued with
them about this but they had claimed it was in their contract that thats what
they would do  maxs eyes swivelled
round to glare at the band  the trumpet was joined by more trumpets 
whats this? whispered max, wild-eyed, whats happening?
at the back of the restaurant the stony-faced party from the church of the
second coming of the great prophet zarquon leapt ecstatically to their feet
chanting and crying 
a big hand please, ladies and gentlemen, he hollered, for the great prophet
zarquon! he has come! zarquon has come again!
thunderous applause broke out as max strode across the stage and handed
his microphone to the prophet 
zarquon coughed 
er   er, look, im sorry im a bit late  ive had the most
ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment 



one of the major selling point of that wholly remarkable travel book, the
hitch hikers guide to the galaxy, apart from its relative cheapness and the
fact that it has the words dont panic written in large friendly letters on its
cover, is its compendious and occasionally accurate glossary  the statistics
relating to the geo-social nature of the universe, for instance, are deftly set
out between pages nine hundred and thirty-eight thousand and twenty-four
and nine hundred and thirty-eight thousand and twenty-six; and the simplistic
style in which they are written is partly explained by the fact that the editors,
having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information off the back of a
packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it with a few footnoted in order
to avoid prosecution under the incomprehensibly tortuous galactic copyright
laws 
it is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the book backwards
in time through a temporal warp, and then successfully sued the breakfast
cereal company for infringement of the same laws 
the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy offers this definition of the word
infinite  much bigger than
that in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunning size, wow, thats
big, time  infinity is just so big that by comparison, bigness itself looks really
titchy  the altairan dollar has recently collapsed, the flaninian pobble
bead is only exchangeable for other flaninian pobble beads, and the triganic
pu has its own very special problems  its exchange rate of eight ningis to one
pu is simple enough, but since a ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand
eight hundred miles across each side, no one has ever collected enough to own
one pu  ningis are not negotiable currency because the galactibanks refuse
to deal in fiddling small change  from this basic premise it is very simple to
prove that the galactibanks are also the product of a deranged imagination 
the function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there simply isnt
a mirror big enough - see point one 
however, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now because
it really is terribly complicated  tempo-
ral relastatics held it and protected it in a nothingness that wasnt merely a
vacuum, it was simply nothing - there was nothing in which a vacuum could
be said to exist 
the force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque, the party was
over, the diners were leaving, zarquon had vanished along with the rest of
the universe, the time turbines were preparing to pull the restaurant back
across the brink of time in readiness for the lunch sitting, and max quordle-
pleen was back in his small curtained dressing room trying to raise his agent
on the tempophone 
in to the car park came the late mr hotblack desiato, propelled along the
moving catwalk by his bodyguard  as they approached the limoship a hatchway
swung down from its side, engaged the wheels of the wheelchair and drew it
inside  here he operated
the remote control system which activated the autopilot in the black ship lying
next to the limo, thus causing great relief to zaphod beeblebrox who had been
trying to start the thing for over ten minutes 
the black ship glided smoothly forward out of its bay, turned, and moved
down the central causeway swiftly and quietly 
the milliways lunch menu quotes, by permission, a passage from the hitch
hikers guide to the galaxy 
what it doesnt go on to say is that though it will usually take a large civi-
lization many thousands of years to pass through the how, why and where
phases, small social groupings under stressful conditions can pass through them
with extreme rapidity 
badly, said ford prefect 
where are we going? said trillian 
i dont know, said zaphod beeblebrox 
shut up, suggested zaphod beeblebrox and ford prefect 
basically, what youre trying to say, said arthur dent, ignoring this sugges-
tion, is that were out of control 
the ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as ford and zaphod tried to
wrest control from the autopilot  the engined howled and whined like tired
children in a supermarket 
its the wild colour scheme that freaks me, said zaphod whose love affair
with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into the flight, every time you
try to operate on of these weird black controls that are labelled in black on a
black background, a little black light lights up black to let you know youve
done it  what is this? some kind of galactic hyperhearse?
the walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the ceiling was black, the seats
- which were rudimentary since the only important trip this ship was designed
for was supposed to be unmanned - were black, the control panel was black, the
instruments were black, the little screws that held them in place were black,
the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black, and when they had lifted up a
corner of it they had discovered that the foam underlay also was black 
perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different wave-
lengths, offered trillian 
or didnt have much imagination, muttered arthur 
in fact, though they werent to know it, the decor had been chosen in honour
of its owners sad, lamented, and tax-deductible condition 

107

take it easy, pleaded arthur, youre making me space sick 
go ahead, said zaphod, we could do with a little colour about this place 
zaphod left the controls for ford to figure out, and lurched over to arthur 
look, earthman, he said angrily, youve got a job to do, right? the ques-
tion to the ultimate answer, right?
what, that thing? said arthur, i thought wed forgotten about that  the meaning of life! we get our fingers on
that we can hold every shrink in the galaxy up to ransom, and thats worth a
bundle  i mean, whats six times seven?
zaphod looked at him hard for a moment  then his eyes blazed with excite-
ment 
zaphods faces fell 
im just saying that the question could be anything at all, said arthur, and
i dont see how i am meant to know 
because, hissed zaphod, you were there when your planet did the big
firework 
had, corrected zaphod  look, i just dont know 
its printed in the earthmans brainwave patterns, continued marvin, but
i dont suppose youll be very interested in knowing that 
it amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small 
ah, ignore him, said zaphod, hes only making it up 
making it up? said marvin, swivelling his head in a parody of astonishment,
why should i want to make anything up? lifes bad enough as it is without
wanting to invent any more of it 
marvin, said trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she was still capa-
ble of assuming in talking to this misbegotten creature, if you knew all along,
why then didnt you tell us?
marvins head swivelled back to her 
you didnt ask, he said simply  have you worked out the con-
trols of this boat?
no, said ford, i just stopped fiddling with them 
yeah, right, said zaphod 
i could tell you werent really interested, murmured marvin to himself and
slumped into a corner and switched himself off  if it is what i think it is, and if its saying
what i think its saying, then weve already gone too far back into the past 
zaphod shrugged 
me, said zaphod 
zaphod strode over to the console 

109

he got no further 
the ship dropped out fo time travel mode and re-emerged into real space 
a large vision screen above the console winked into life revealing a wide
starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead of them 
none of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that zaphod was
at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the rear of the cabin, as
were all the others 
they were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that thuddered out
of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision screen 



down on the dry, red world of kakrafoon, in the middle of the vast rudlit
desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound system  anyone within five miles of
the speaker silos wouldnt have survived the tuning up 
if arthur dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos then his expiring
thought would have been that in both size and shape the sound rig closely re-
sembled manhattan  risen out of the silos, the neutron phase speaker stacks
towered monstrously against the sky, obscuring the banks of plutonium reac-
tors and seismic amps behind them 
buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay the instru-
ments that the musicians would control from their ship, the massive photon-
ajuitar, the bass detonator and the megabang drum complex  hotblack desiatos
limoship, a mere tadpole beside it, had arrived and docked, and the lamented
gentleman was being transported down the high vaulted corridors to meet the
medium who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar key-
board 
a doctor, a logician and a marine biologist had also just arrived, flown in at
phenomenal expense from maximegalon to try to reason with the lead singer
who had locked himself in the bathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing
to come out till it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasnt a fish 
frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a beach on112

chapter 20 

santraginus v over a hundred light years away where, he claimed, he had been
happy over half an hour now and had found a small stone that would be his
friend  it meant that for the seventeenth
time on this tour the drums would be played by a robot and that therefore the
timing of the cymbalistics would be right  gonna
be a great sundive 
zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched frequencies on the sub-ether
receiver before the next mind-pulverizing noise hit them  he stood there quiv-
ering 
what, said trillian in a small quiet voice, does sundive mean?
it means, said marvin, that the ship os going to dive into the sun  what do you expect if you steal
hotblack desiatos stunt ship?
how do you know   said zaphod in a voice that would make a vegan snow
lizard feel chilly, that this is hotblack desiatos stuntship?
simple, said marvin, i parked it for him  didnt  
thats what i said, confirmed marvin  im standing here in front
of the stage, the reporter lied, in the middle of the rudlit desert, and with

113

the aid of hyperbinoptic glasses i can just about make out the huge audience
cowering there on the horizon all around me  behind me the speaker stacks rise
like a sheer cliff face, and high above me the sun is shining away and doesnt
know whats going to hit it  the environmentalist lobby do know whats going
to hit it, and they claim that the concert will cause earthquakes, tidal waves,
hurricanes, irreparable damage to the atmosphere, and all the usual things
that environmentalists usually go on about 
but ive just had a report that a representative of disaster area met with
the environmentalists at lunchtime, and had them all shot, so nothing now lies
in the way of  
zaphod switched it off 
you know what im thinking? he said 
tell me what you think im thinking 
i think youre thinking its time we get off this ship 
i think youre right, said zaphod 
i think youre right, said ford 
i wish youd stop saying that, said ford 
it is worth repeating at this point the theories that ford had come up with, on
his first encounter with human beings, to account for their peculiar habit of
continually stating and restating the very very obvious, as it its a nice day,
or youre very tall, or so this is it, were going to die 
his first theory was that if human beings didnt keep exercising their lips, their
mouths probably seized up 
after a few months of observation he had come up with a second theory, which
was this - if human beings dont keep exercising their lips, their brains start
working 
in fact, this second theory is more literally true of the belcebron people of
kakrafoon 
the belcebron people used to cause great resentment and insecurity amongst
neighboring races by being one of the most enlightened, accomplished, and
above all quiet civilizations in the galaxy 
as a punishment for this behaviour, which was held to be offensively self righ-
teous and provocative, a galactic tribunal inflicted on them that most cruel
of all social diseases, telepathy 

the weather, their little aches and pains, the match this afternoon and what a
noisy place kakrafoon had suddenly become 
the ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order to hit the sun
six minutes and thirty-seven seconds before the climax of the song to which it
related, so that the light of the solar flares had time to travel out to kakrafoon 
the ship had already been diving for several minutes by the time that ford
prefect had completed his search of the other compartments of the black ship 
the sun of kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision screen, its blaz-
ing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment by moment as
the ship plunged onwards, unheeding the thumping and banging of zaphods
hands on the control panel  arthur and trillian had the fixed expressions of
rabbits on a night road who think that the best way of dealing with approach-
ing headlights is to stare them out 
zaphod span round, wild-eyed 
zaphod gibbered 
ford goggled 
didnt you tell them who we were?
oh yeah 
ford pushed arthur aside and leaned forward over the control console 
smash the autopilot 
incidentally, he said, what does teleport mean?
another moment passed 
probably the wrong moment to ask, said arthur, its just i remember hear-

115

ing you use the word a short while ago and i only bring it up because  
where, said ford prefect quietly, does it say teleport?
well, just over here in fact, said arthur, pointing at a dark control box in the
rear of the cabin, just under the word emergency, above the word system
and beside the sign saying out of order 
in the pandemonium that instantly followed, the only action to follow was that
of ford prefect lunging across the cabin to the small black box that arthur
had indicated and stabbing repeatedly at the single small black button set into
it 
a six-foot square panel slid open beside it revealing a compartment which re-
sembled a multiple shower unit that had found a new function in life as an
electricians junk store  half- finished wiring hung from the ceiling, a jumble
of abandoned components lay strewn on the floor, and the programming panel
lolled out of the cavity in the wall into which it should have been secured 
a junior disaster area accountant, visiting the shipyard where this ship was
being constructed, had demanded to know of the works foreman why the hell
they were fitting an extremely expensive teleport into a ship which only had
one important journey to make, and that unmanned  the foreman had ex-
plained that the teleport was available at a ten per cent discount and the ac-
countant had explained that this was immaterial; the foreman had explained
that it was the finest, most powerful and sophisticated teleport that money
could buy and the accountant had explained that the money did not wish to
buy it; the foreman had explained that people would still need to enter and
leave the ship and the accountant had explained that the ship sported a per-
fectly serviceable door; the foreman had explained that the accountant could
go and boil his head and the accountant had explained to the foreman that
the thing approaching him rapidly from his left was a knuckle sandwich  after
the explanations had been concluded, work was discontinued on the teleport
which subsequently passed unnoticed on the invoice as sund  explns 
hells donkeys, muttered zaphod as he and ford attempted to sort through
the tangle of wiring  he tossed a coin into the
teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling control panel  a
matter transference teleport without guidance programming could put you  
the sun of kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen 

and, said ford, there is no autosystem  we couldnt all go 
hey, marvin kid, said zaphod brightly, how you doing?
very badly i suspect, muttered marvin 
a shortish while later, the concert on kakrafoon reached an unexpected cli-
max  massive solar flares licked out from it millions
of miles into space, thrilling and in a few cases spilling the dozen or so flare
riders who had been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of
the moment 
moments before the flare light reached kakrafoon the pounding desert cracked
along a deep faultline  a huge and hitherto undetected underground river ly-
ing far beneath the surface gushed to the surface to be followed seconds later
by the eruption of millions of tons of boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet
into the air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and below the
surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side of the world and back again  at that precise moment the
solar radiation from the flares filtered through the clouds of vaporized water
and struck the ground  the
sun blazed less harshly in the summer, the cold bit less bitterly in the winter,
pleasant rain fell more often, and slowly the desert world of kakrafoon became
a paradise  even the telepathic power with which the people of kakrafoon had
been cursed was permanently dispersed by the force of the explosion 
a spokesman for disaster area - the one who had had all the environmentalists
shot - was later quoted as saying that it had been a good gig  a few sceptical
scientists examined the records of the events more closely, and claimed that
they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast artificially induced improbability
field drifting in from a nearby region of space  hangovers hed had, but never
anything on this scale 
being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull stomping throb
he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought  on earth - when there had been an earth, before it was demolished
to make way for a new hyperspace bypass - the problem had been with cars 
the disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the
ground where it had been safely hidden out of harms way, turning it into tar
to cover the land with, smoke to fill the air with and pouring the rest into the
sea, all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly
from one place to another - particularly when the place you arrived at had
probably become, as a result of this, very similar to the place you had left, i 
and what about matter transference beams? any form of transport which
involved tearing you apart atom by atom, flinging those atoms through the
sub-ether, and then jamming them back together again just when they were
getting their first taste of freedom for years had to be bad news  here is one that used regularly to be
chanted by huge crowds outside the sirius cybernetics corporation teleport
systems factory on happi-werld iii:
aldebarans great, ok,
algols pretty neat,
betelgeuses pretty girls,
will knock you off your feet 118

chapter 21 

theyll do anything you like,
real fast and then real slow,
but if you have to take me apart to get me there,
then i dont want to go 
singing,
take me apart, take me apart,
what a way to roam,
and if you have to take me apart to get me there,
id rather stay at home 
sirius is paved with gold
so ive heard it said
by nuts who then go on to say
see tau before youre dead 
i teleported home one night,
with ron and sid and meg,
ron stole meggies heart away,
and i got sidneys leg 
arthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding, though he was still aware of a
dull stomping throb 
can you hear a dull stomping throb? said ford prefect  ford prefect was approaching
looking red eyed and pasty  the outer steel wall - which was
painted in that sickly shade of pale green which they use in schools, hospitals
and mental asylums to keep the inmates subdued - curved over the tops of
their heads where it met the inner perpendicular wall which, oddly enough
was covered in dark brown hessian wall weave  the floor was of dark green
ribbed rubber 

119

i think were in a spaceship of some kind, he said 
down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb 
nowhere about, he said, ive looked  an unpro-
grammed teleport can throw you light years in any direction  judging by the
way i feel i should think weve travelled a very long way indeed 
do you think theyre  
where they are, how they are, theres no way we can know and no way we
can do anything about it 
what?
dont think about it  that stomping throb 
not that way, said ford, thats where theyre coming from 
no its not, said arthur, theyre coming from that way 
theyre not, theyre   other corridors gave off it to the left and right, each very dark and
each subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed 

stories his favourite mother used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a
betelgeusian, ankle high to an arcturan megagrasshopper: stories of dead
ships, haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions of deep
space infested with demons or the ghosts of forgotten crews; stories too of in-
cautious travellers who found and entered such ships; stories of   however ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their death
hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay any money you liked it wasnt with
hessian wall weave 
a moment later they leap like startled lizards down the nearest corridor junc-
tion as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly hove into view directly in
front of them 
hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two dozen
overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits panting and
wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon gibber 
ford prefect stared after them 
joggers, said ford prefect with a shrug 
and the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine things that hit their
eyes were also coffins  at the far end, about three
hundred yards away an archway let through to what appeared to be a similar
chamber, similarly occupied 
ford prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the floor of the
vault 
whats so great about dead people? asked arthur, nervously stepping down
after him 
dunno, said ford, lets find out shall we?
on closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like sarcophagi  the tops were semi-translucent, and through them could dimly
be perceived the features of their late and presumably lamented occupants 
they were humanoid, and had clearly left the troubles of whatever world it
was they came from far behind them, but beyond that little else could be dis-
cerned 
rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a heavy, oily white
gas which arthur at first thought might be there to give the place a little
atmosphere until he discovered that it also froze his ankles  the sarcophagi
too were intensely cold to the touch  he pulled a corner of his
towel out of his satchel and started to rub furiously at something 
look, theres a plaque on this one, he explained to arthur, its frosted
over  to arthur
they looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one too many of what-
ever it is that spiders have on a night out, but ford instantly recognized an122

chapter 22 

early form of galactic eezeereed 
it says golgafrincham ark fleet, ship b, hold seven, telephone sanitizer
second class - and a serial number 
but whats he doing here?
ford peered through the top at the figure within 
not a lot, he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins of his which
always made people think hed been overdoing things recently and should try
to get some rest 
he scampered over to another sarcophagus  a moments brisk towel work and
he announced:
this ones a dead hairdresser  hoopy!
the next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of an ad-
vertising account executive; the one after that contained a second-hand car
salesman, third class 
an inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught fords attention, and
he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at the clouds of freezing gas
that threatened to envelope him  why in fact is anyone going to all the trou-
ble and expense of carting five thousand dead bodies through space?
ten thousand, said arthur, pointing at the archway through which the next
chamber was dimly visible 
fifteen thousand, he said, theres another lot down there 
thats a lot, said ford, a lot a lot 
turn around slowly, barked the voice, and put your hands up 
hello? said ford, turning round slowly, putting his hands up and not mak-
ing any other move 
why, said arthur dent, isnt anyone ever pleased to see us?
standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had entered the vault
was the man who wasnt pleased to see them  his displeasure was communi-
cated partly by the barking hectoring quality of his voice and partly by the
viciousness with which he waved a long silver kill-o-zap gun at them 

123

make it evil, hed been told  if that means sticking all sort of
spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it  people who can supply that amount of fire power dont need
to supply verbs as well 
turning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty-four oncoming joggers,
now showered and changed, who swept on past them into the vault 
move! screamed their captor 
in the vault the joggers went to twenty-four empty sarcophagi along the side
wall, opened them, climbed in, and fell into twenty-four dreamless sleeps 
yes, number one?
just heard a sort of report thingy from number two  from where he reclined beneath a wide
domed bubble he could see before and above them the vast panorama of stars
through which they were moving - a panorama that had thinned out noticably
during the course of the voyage  turning and looking backwards, over the
vast two-mile bulk of the ship he could see the far denser mass of stars behind
them which seemed to form almost a solid band  this was the view through
the galactic centre from which they were travelling, and indeed had been trav-
elling for years, at a speed that he couldnt quite remember at the moment,
but he knew it was terribly fast  he didnt let it worry him though  the scientist chaps had
been very insistent that everything was going to be perfectly alright providing
nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit in an orderly fashion 
he wasnt panicking  as far as he was concerned everything was going splen-
didly 
the captain wasnt a man to kick a chap when he was bending over trying to126

chapter 23  oxy-
gen levels still being maintained, captain  seemed pretty unlikely to him, but he wasnt
one to stand in his officers way 
well, perhaps thatll keep him happy for a bit, he said, hes always wanted
some 
ford prefect and arthur dent trudged onwards up the ships apparently end-
less corridors 
to the eyes of ford prefect and arthur dent, the most remarkable thing about
the ships bridge was not the fifty foot diameter hemispherical dome which cov-
ered it, and through which the dazzling display of stars shone down on them:
to people who have eaten at the restaurant at the end of the universe, such
wonders are commonplace  nor was it the bewildering array of instruments
that crowded the long circumferential wall around them  to arthur this was
exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to look like, and to ford it
looked thoroughly antiquated: it confirmed his suspicions that disaster areas
stuntship had taken them back at least a million, if not two million, years be-
fore their own time 
the bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water crystal and
was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the maximegalon museum
of diseased imaginings  an intestinal jumble of plumbing had been picked out
in gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave; the
taps and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump 
as the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly wrong, and
it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this that number two
approached it 
captain, sir! he shouted through clenched teeth - a difficult trick but hed
had years during which to perfect it 
i have brought you the prisoners i located in freezer bay seven, sir! he
yapped 
er  
the captain beamed at them  so number two had really found some prison-
ers  well, good for him, thought the captain, nice to see a chap doing what
hes best at  well, jynnan tonnyx all round then  look in the fridge number one 
it is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how much importance
to attach, that something like 85% of all known worlds in the galaxy, be they
primitive or highly advanced, have invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or
gee-nn-tn-ix, or jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations
on the same phonetic theme  the drinks themselves are not the same, and
vary between the sivolvian chinanto/mnigs which is ordinary water server
at slightly above room temperature, and the gagrakackan tzjin-anthony-ks
which kills cows at a hundred paces; and in fact the one common factor be-
tween all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they
were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with
any other worlds  as far as any theory
of structural linguistics is concerned it is right off the graph, and yet it per-
sists  structural linguistics is a bitterly
divided and unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend
too many nights drowning their problems in ouisghian zodahs 
dont you want to interrogate the prisoners sir? he squealed 
the captain peered at him in bemusement 
why on golgafrincham should i want to do that? he asked 

oh no, no, no, said the captain, i expect they just dropped in for a quick
jynnan tonnyx, dont you?
but sir, theyre my prisoners! i must interrogate them!
the captain looked at them doubtfully  he advanced slowly on ford
prefect and arthur dent 
all right, you scum, he growled, you vermin  
well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me, said ford, what about
you arthur?
arthur blinked 
lemon??!!
yes please, said ford, and do you have any of those little biscuits? you
know, the cheesy ones?
im asking the questions!!!! howled number two, his body quaking with
apoplectic fury 
sir?!
push off, would you, theres a good chap  im trying to have a relaxing bath 
number twos eyes narrowed and became what are known in the shouting and
killing people trade as cold slits, the idea presumably being to give your op-
ponent the impression that you have lost your glasses or are having difficulty
keeping awake  if, whilst
wandering through the jungle of traal, you were suddenly to come upon the
fabled ravenous bugblatter beast, you would have reason to be grateful if
its mouth was a thin hard line rather than, as it usually is, a gaping mass of
slavering fangs 
may i remind you sir, hissed number two at the captain, that you have
now been in that bath for over three years?! this final shot delivered, num-
ber two spun on his heel and stalked off to a corner to practise darting eye
movements in the mirror  he gave ford prefect a lame smile 

129

well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine, he said 
er   he and arthur took their jynnan tonnyx 
i mean, i couldnt help noticing, said ford, also taking a sip, the bodies  could it be that the captain doesnt know hes got fifteen million
dead bodies on his ship?
the captain was nodding cheerfully at him  the first officer was just
standing there holding the drinks tray and smiling benignly 
yes, he said, all those dead telephone sanitizers and account executives,
you know, down in the hold 
oh theyre not dead, he said, good lord no, no theyre frozen  theyre
going to be revived 
you mean youve got a hold full of frozen hairdressers? he said  were going to colonize
another planet 
exciting isnt it? said the captain 
ah, now dont misunderstand me, said the captain, were just one of the
ships in the ark fleet  were the b ark you see  so what everyone thought was, lets pack the whole population into
some giant spaceships and go and settle on another planet  so it was decided to build three ships, you see,
three arks in space, and   im not boring you am i?
no, no, said ford firmly, its fascinating 
number twos eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then settled
back on the mirror, like a pair of flies briefly distracted from their favourite
prey of months old meat 
trouble with a long journey like this, continued the captain, is that you
end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets terribly boring because half
the time you know what youre going to say next 
yes, about half id say  anyway - wheres the soap? he fished around and
found it 

131

yes, so anyway, he resumed, the idea was that into the first ship, the a
ship, would go all the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you
know, all the achievers; and into the third, or c ship, would go all the people
who did the actual work, who made things and did things, and then into the
b ship - thats us - would go everyone else, the middlemen you see 
the little bathing tune, which had been composed for him by one of his worlds
most exciting and prolific jingle writer (who was currently asleep in hold thirty-
six some nine hundred yards behind them) covered what would otherwise have
been an awkward moment of silence 
er  
oh, said the first officer suddenly, i thought it was that the planet was
going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot piranha bees  wasnt
that it?
number two span around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that only comes
with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in 
thats not what i was told! he hissed, my commanding officer told me
that the entire planet was in imminent danger of being eaten by an enormous
mutant star goat!
oh really   said ford prefect 
yes! a monstrous creature from the pit of hell with scything teeth ten thou-
sand miles long, breath that would boil oceans, claws that could tear continents
from their roots, a thousand eyes that burned like the sun, slavering jaws a
million miles across, a monster such as you have never   and the
other ships, er  

132

chapter 23  well its funny you should say that, he said and allowed himself a slight
frown at ford prefect, because curiously enough we havent heard a peep out
of them since we left five years ago  
he glanced at ford prefect who raised his eyebrows at him  i mean does it strike you as odd
number two?
errrrrrrrrrrr  
well, said ford, i can see that youve got a lot of things youre going to
talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you could sort of drop us off at
the nearest convenient planet  
ah, well thats a little difficult you see, said the captain, because our tra-
jectory thingy was preset before we left golgafrincham, i think partly because
im not very good with figures  
you mean were stuck here on this ship? exclaimed ford suddenly losing
patience with the whole charade, when are you meant to be reaching this
planet youre meant to be colonizing?
oh, were nearly there i think, said the captain, any second now  oh, i dont know though,
why stop just when im enjoying it?
so were actually going to land in a minute?
well not so much land, in fact, not actually land as such, no   er   er  
youre a load of useless bloody loonies! he shouted 
ah yes, that was it, beamed the captain, that was the reason 

133

134

chapter 23 



the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy has this to say about the planet of
golgafrincham: it is a planet with an ancient and mysterious history, rich in
legend, red, and occasionally green with the blood of those who sought in times
gone by to conquer her; a land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and
sultry air heady with the scent of the perfumed springs that trickle over its
hot and dusty rocks and nourish the dark and musty lichens beneath; a land
of fevered brows and intoxicated imaginings, particularly amongst those who
taste the lichens; a land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who
have learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath; a land also
of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and of the spirit 
and in all this ancient and mysterious history, the most mysterious figures
of all were without doubt those of the great circling poets of arium  these
circling poets used to live in remote mountain passes where they would lie in
wait for small bands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks
at them 
and when the travellers cried out, saying why didnt they go away and get
on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with all this rock-
throwing business, they would suddenly stop, and then break into one of the
seven hundred and ninety-four great song cycles of vassilian 
the first part of each song would tell how there once went forth from the city
of vassilian a party of five sage princes with four horses  the princes, who are
of course brave, noble and wise, travel widely in distant lands, fought giant
ogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea with weird gods and rescue beauti-
ful monsters from ravening princesses before finally announcing that they have
achieved enlightenment and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished 136

chapter 24 

the second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of all their
bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back  it was, however, a descendant of one
of these eccentric poets who invented the spurious tales of impending doom
which enabled the people of golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire use-
less third of their population 



that night the ship crash-landed on to an utterly insignificant little green-blue
planet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the uncharted backwa-
ters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy 
in the hours preceding the crash ford prefect had fought furiously but in vain
to unlock the controls of the ship from their pre-ordained flight path  it had
quickly become apparent to him that the ship had been programmed to con-
vey its payload safely, in uncomfortably, to its new home but to cripple itself
beyond repair in the process 
its screaming, blazing descent through the atmosphere had stripped away most
of its superstructure and outer shielding, and its final inglorious bellyflop into
a murky swamp had left its crew only a few hours of darkness during which to
revive and offload its deep-frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began to
settle almost at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the stagnant slime 
once or twice during the night it was starkly silhouetted against the sky as
burning meteors - the detritus of its descent - flashed across the sky 
when the sun came up that morning it shed its thin watery light over a vast
area heaving with wailing hairdressers, public relations executives, opinion
pollsters and the rest, all clawing their way desperately to dry land 
countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp in the night,
and millions more had been sucked down with the ship, but those that survived
still numbered hundreds of thousands and as the day wore on they crawled out
over the surrounding countryside, each looking for a few square feet of solid138

chapter 25 
from a nearby hillside ford prefect and arthur dent watched the horror of
which they could not feel a part 
an imaginative solution to a problem id have thought, he said 
forty-two! he said with a malicious grin, no, doesnt work 
arthur looked at him as if hed gone mad and, seeing nothing to indicate the
contrary, realized that it would be perfectly reasonable to assume that this
had in fact happened 
i think theyll manage for a while, he said 
well, i dont know about you, said ford again after a moment, but im
off 
er, when you say youre off, what do you mean exactly? said arthur 
good question, said ford, im getting total silence 
looking over his shoulder arthur saw that he was twiddling with knobs on a

139

small box 
the earth having been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass
meant that this view of things was a little lopsided, but arthur tended to
cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact with his home 
sausage, thought arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at the primitive world
about him, what i wouldnt give for a good earth sausage 
would you believe, said ford in exasperation, that there are no transmis-
sions of any kind within light years of this benighted tip? are you listening to
me?
what? said arthur 
until we pick up anything on this machine, said ford, our chances of get-
ting off this planet are zero 



i trust you had a pleasant meal? said zarniwoop to zaphod and trillian as
they rematerialized on the bridge of the starship heart of gold and lay panting
on the floor 
zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him 
i have programmed the computer with the improbability coordinates per-
tinent to our journey, said zarniwoop, we will arrive there very shortly 
meanwhile, why dont you relax and prepare yourself for the meeting?
zaphod said nothing  he got up again and marched over to a small cabinet
from which he pulled a bottle of old janx spirit 
and when this is all done, said zaphod savagely, its done, alright? im
free to go and do what the hell i like and lie on beaches and stuff?
it depends what transpires from the meeting, said zarniwoop 
zaphod, who is this man? said trillian shakily, wobbling to her feet, whats
he doing here? whys he on our ship?
hes a very stupid man, said zaphod, who wants to meet the man who
rules the universe 
ah, said trillian taking the bottle from zaphod and helping herself, a social
climber 
and so this is the situation we find: a succession of galactic presidents who so
much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in power that they very rarely notice
that theyre not 



on a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in particular
- nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it is protected by a vast
field of unprobability to which only six men in this galaxy have a key - it was
raining 
it was bucketing down, and had been for hours  it beat the top of the sea into
a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped a stretch of scrubby land
near the sea into a mudbath 
the rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the small shack
that stood in the middle of this patch of scrubby land  it obliterated the small
rough pathway that led from the shack down to the seashore and smashed
apart the neat piles of interesting shells which had been placed there 
the noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening within, but went
largely unnoticed by its occupant, whose attention was otherwise engaged 
he was a tall shambling man with rough straw-coloured hair that was damp
from the leaking roof 
pussy, pussy, pussy, he said, coochicoochicoochicoo   pussy want it?
the cat seemed undecided on the matter  it pawed rather condescendingly at
the piece of fish the man was holding out, and then got distracted by a piece
of dust on the floor  i think it is better if i dont
get involved 
ah, i seem to see you eating it, he said at last, as the cat exhausted the
entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust and pounced on to the fish 
i like it when i see you eat the fish, said the man, because in my mind you
will waste away if you dont  this had a
crossword on it 
fish come from far away, he said, or so im told  or so i imagine im told 
and when i hear their questions, do you hear questions? what do their
voices mean to you? perhaps you just think theyre singing songs to you  he
reflected on this, and saw the flaw in the supposition 
perhaps they are singing songs to you, he said, and i just think theyre
asking me questions  theres mud on the floor,
cigarettes and whisky on the table, fish on a plate for you and a memory of
them in my mind  hardly conclusive evidence i know, but then all evidence is
circumstantial  and look what else theyve left me 
crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator 
he played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to sleep and the

147

rain outside continued to pour  eventually he put the calculator aside 
he inhaled deeply and sat back  ive never seen a big white one, just the six black ones 
he stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by the mattress 
a hundred yards away, pelted by the torrential rain, lay the heart of gold 
in there? shouted trillian above the noise of the rain 
yes, said zarniwoop 
weird, said zaphod 
do you rule the universe? said zaphod 
i try not to, he said, are you wet?
zaphod looked at him in astonishment 
wet? he cried, doesnt it look as if were wet?
thats how it looks to me, said the man, but how you feel about it might
be an altogether different matter  if you feel warmth makes you dry, youd
better come in 
they looked around the tiny shack, zarniwoop with slight distaste, trillian

148

chapter 28 

with interest, zaphod with delight 
hey, er   said zaphod, whats your name?
the man looked at them doubtfully 
i dont know 
he invited trillian to sit in the chair  he sat on the edge of the chair, zarni-
woop leaned stiffly against the table and zaphod lay on the mattress 
would he like that? asked zaphod 
youd better ask him, said the man 
does he talk? said zaphod 
zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket 
zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper 
how long have you been doing this?
ah, said the man, this is a question about the past is it?
zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement  this wasnt exactly what he had
been expecting 
how can i tell, said the man, that the past isnt a fiction designed to ac-
count for the discrepancy between my immediate physical sensations and my
state of mind?
zarniwoop stared at him 
zaphod laughed happily 
ill drink to that, he said and pulled out the bottle of janx spirit  he handed the bottle to trillian 
and they ask you, said zarniwoop, to take decisions for them? about

149

peoples lives, about worlds, about economies, about wars, about everything
going on out there in the universe?
out there? said the man, out where?
out there! said zarniwoop pointing at the door 
how can you tell theres anything out there, said the man politely, the
doors closed 
but you know theres a whole universe out there! cried zarniwoop  you
cant dodge your responsibilities by saying they dont exist!
the ruler of the universe thought for a long while whilst zarniwoop quivered
with anger 
youre very sure of your facts, he said at last, i couldnt trust the thinking
of a man who takes the universe - if there is one - for granted 
zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent 
but dont you believe in anything?
the man shrugged and picked up his cat 
i dont understand what you mean, he said 
you dont understand that what you decide in this shack of yours affects the
lives and fates of millions of people? this is all monstrously wrong!
i dont know  ive never met all these people you speak of  they
have their own universes of their own eyes and ears 
trillian said:
i think im just popping outside for a moment 
do you believe other people exist? insisted zarniwoop  how can i say?
id better see whats up with trillian, said zaphod and slipped out 
outside, he said to her:
i think the universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?
very good, said trillian 
inside, zarniwoop continued 
but dont you understand that people live or die on your word?
the ruler of the universe waited for as long as he could 

ah! barked zarniwoop, you say the lord 
zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about 
what other two? said the ruler of the universe, settling back into his chair
and refilling his whisky glass 
beeblebrox and the girl! the two who were here!
i remember no one 
stuff it, snapped zarniwoop and ran out into the rain 
the rain continued to churn the mud  various noises continued outside,
but he didnt know whether they were real or not  the night was cool and balmy, the air pure, the sub-
etha sens 
a wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical calm which combined
with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter of insects and the bril-
liant light of the stars to soothe their jangled spirits  all that day they
had passed through rolling green hills and valleys, richly covered with grasses,
wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees, the sun had warmed them,
light breezes had kept them cool, and ford prefect had checked his sub-etha
sens-o-matic at less and less frequent intervals, and had exhibited less and
less annoyance at its continued silence 
cool though the night air was they slept soundly and comfortably in the open
and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall feeling refreshed but hun-
gry  ford had stuffed some small rolls into his satchel at milliways and they
breakfasted off those before moving on 
shortly before noon they had their first indication that the world they had
landed on was not an uninhabited one: a half glimpsed face amongst the trees,
watching them  it vanished at the moment they both saw it, but the image
they were both left with was of a humanoid creature, curious to see them but
not alarmed 152

chapter 29  around
some of the women huddled some small children and behind the group was a
ramshackle array of small dwellings made of mud and branches 
the tallest of the men stood a little over five feet high, they all stooped for-
ward slightly, had longish arms and lowish foreheads, and clear bright eyes
with which they stared intently at the strangers  the natives seemed puzzled by the intruders, and whilst they showed
no sign of aggression they were quite clearly not issuing any invitations 
ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh, he said quietly  he had grown so used to receiving an in-
stantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he heard via the babel
fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to be aware of it, and he was only
reminded of its presence now by the fact that it didnt seem to be working  he guessed, correctly as it happens,
that these people had as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments of
language, and that the babel fish was therefore powerless to help 
i think, said ford out of the corner of his mouth, hes asking us if wed
mind walking on round the edge of the village 
ruurgggghhhh urrgggh; urgh urgh (uh ruh) rruurruuh ug, continued the
man-creature 
slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the clearing  a few hundred
yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small pile of fruit lying in
their path - berries that looked remarkably like raspberries and blackberries,
and pulpy, green skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears 
so far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had seen, though
the trees and bushed were laden with them 
look at it this way, ford prefect had said, fruit and berries on strange
planets either make you live or make you die  therefore the point at which to
start toying with them is when youre going to die if you dont 
look at it this way, said ford, er  
im trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to eat it,
said ford  the things which looked like raspberries and strawberries were fatter
and riper than any arthur had ever seen, even in ice cream commercials 
why dont we eat them and think about it afterwards? he said 
maybe thats what they want us to do  if its poisonous and we dont eat it theyll just attack us
some other way  if we dont eat, we lose out either way 
i like the way youre thinking, said ford, now eat one 

what you like guys, oh, but dont eat the apple  surprise surprise, they eat
it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting gotcha  it wouldnt have
made any difference if they hadnt eaten it 
why not?
because if youre dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which
likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly
well they wont give up  theyll get you in the end 
a few moments later, when they had eaten the lot, ford prefect turned round
and called out  thank you very much, he called, youre very kind 
life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a while at least they were able to
cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by deciding to ignore them 
when the craving for company became too great they would know where to
find it, but for the moment they were happy to feel that the golgafrinchans
were hundreds of miles behind them 
nevertheless, ford prefect began to use his sub-etha sens-o-matic more of-
ten again 
on a whim they turned northwards  arthur suspected a streak of masochism in
ford prefect - the increasing difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a
sense of purpose that was otherwise lacking 
their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous terrain of
breathtaking sweep and beauty  the vast, jagged, snow covered peaks rav-
ished their senses 
they wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which ford prefect acquired
by a technique he once learned from a couple of ex-pralite monks running a
mind-surfing resort in the hills of hunian 
the galaxy is littered with ex-pralite monks, all on the make, because the
mental control techniques the order have evolved as a form of devotional dis-
cipline are, frankly, sensational - and extraordinary numbers of monks leave
the order just after they have finished their devotional training and just before
they take their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of
their lives  a wonderful quietness would
descend on the surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from
this transfigured man  slowly the deer would approach, step by step, until it
was almost nuzzling him, whereupon ford prefect would reach out to it and
break its neck 
pheromone control, he said it was, you just have to know how to generate
the right smell  arthur was sitting on a high rock
watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the craggy promontories  he was tense with excitement - his eyes darted up
to meet arthurs  ive already seen it 
no, said ford, youve looked at it, you havent seen it 
his mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadnt got anything to
say yet and shut it again  his brain then started to contend with the problem158

chapter 30  for a second or so the brain tried to catch the left hand
without letting go of the mouth and simultaneously tried to think about what
was buried in the ice, which is probably why the legs went and arthur dropped
restfully to the ground 
the thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network of shad-
ows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the surface  looked at it from
the right angle they resolved into the solid shapes of letters from an alien al-
phabet, each about three feet high; and for those, like arthur, who couldnt
read magrathean there was above the letters the outline of a face hanging in
the ice  it whirled and howled through the trees upsetting
the squirrels  the noise danced and skittered
round the clearing 
the captain, however, regarded the lone bagpiper with an indulgent eye  lit-
tle could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once he had got over the loss of his
gorgeous bath during that unpleasantness in the swamp all those months ago
he had begun to find his new life remarkably congenial  a hollow had been
scooped out of a large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing, and in
this he would bask daily whilst attendants sloshed water over him  not par-
ticularly warm water, it must be said, as they hadnt yet worked out a way of
heating it  to those who said
that they had a feeling soap wasnt found in mines, the captain had ventured
to suggest that perhaps that was because no one had looked hard enough, and
this possibility had been reluctantly acknowledged 
no, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about it was that when the
hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en suite, and when in the
fullness of time the cry came reverberating across the hills that the soap mine
had been located and was producing five hundred cakes a day it would be
more pleasant still 
what else was pleasant, he asked himself? well, so many things: the red and
gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching; the peaceful chatter of
scissors a few feet from his bath where a couple of hairdressers were exercising
their skills on a dozing art director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off160

chapter 31  the
only thing nicer than a phone that didnt ring all the time (or indeed at all)
was six phones that didnt ring all the time (or indeed at all) 
nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people slowly assem-
bling in the clearing around him to watch the afternoon committee meeting 
the captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak  the afternoon
committee meetings were his favourite 
he and arthur dent had been watching the golgafrinchans for almost a week
now, and ford had decided to stir things up a bit  their track suits were now all dirty and even torn, but they all had immac-
ulately styled hair  they couldnt
be interested in botany of a sudden could they?
in the middle of these speculations the captains voice rose above the hubbub 
alright, he said, id like to call this meeting to some sort of order if thats
at all possible  is that alright with everybody? he smiled genially  when youre all ready 
the talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent, except for the
bagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and uninhabitable musical world of
his own 
if there was any reason for this then it escaped ford prefect for the moment 
the crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on him 
the crowd swivelled round  it wasnt what hed prepared  he
decided hed better be a little stronger on the subject 
pity, said the captain, weve all run out you see  havent had a hot bath
in weeks 
well im sorry, said the man huffily, but speaking as a management con-
sultant of many years standing, i must insist on the importance of observing
the committee structure 
hes mad you know, he said, this is a prehistoric planet 
there isnt chair, explained ford, theres only a rock 
the management consultant decided that testiness was what the situation now
called for 
you obviously have no conception, said the management consultant, not
abandoning testiness in favour of good old fashioned hauteur, of modern
business methods 
a girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it 
you mean boulder a motion, tittered a hairdresser 
order, order! yapped the management consultant  he plonked himself down
on the ground to see how long he could keep his temper 
i would like to call to order, he said pleasantly, the five hundred and
seventy-third meeting of the colonization committee of fintlewoodlewix  
this is futile, he exclaimed, five hundred and seventy-three committee
meetings and you havent even discovered fire yet!
if you would care, said the girl with the strident voice, to examine the
agenda sheet  

agenda rock, trilled the hairdresser happily 
thank you, ive made that point, muttered ford  continued the girl firmly, that we are having a
report from the hairdressers fire development sub-committee today  ah - said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is recognized the
whole galaxy over as meaning er, will next tuesday do?
alright, said ford, rounding on him, what have you done? what are you
going to do? what are your thoughts on fire development?
well i dont know, said the hairdresser, all they gave me was a couple of
sticks  
so what have you done with them?
nervously, the hairdresser fished in his track suit top and handed over the
fruits of his labour to ford 
never mind, said ford, rome wasnt burnt in a day 
the crowd hadnt the faintest idea what he was talking about, but they loved
it nevertheless 
well, youre obviously being totally naive of course, said the girl, when
youve been in marketing as long as i have youll know that before any new
product can be developed it has to be properly researched  weve got to find
out what people want from fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it
has for them 
they didnt know, they just thought it was great 
difficulty? exclaimed ford, difficulty? what do you mean, difficulty?
its the single simplest machine in the entire universe!
the marketing girl soured him with a look 
alright, mr wiseguy, she said, youre so clever, you tell us what colour it
should have 

163

the crowd went wild 
almighty zarquon, he said, have none of you done anything?
as if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of noise from the
entrance to the clearing  the crowd couldnt believe the amount of entertain-
ment they were getting this afternoon: in marched a squad of about a dozen
men dressed in the remnants of their golgafrincham 3rd regiment dress uni-
forms  about half of them still carried kill-o-zap guns, the rest now carried
spears which they struck together as they marched 
captain, sir! cried number two - for he was their leader - permission to
report sir!
yes, alright number two, welcome back and all that  find any hot springs?
said the captain despondently 
no sir!
thought you wouldnt  after a while he got it, or at least
the best silence he could hope for under the circumstances: the circumstances
were that the bagpiper was spontaneously composing a national anthem 
oh yes, said the captain, weve given him a grant  instead he slung a well judged rock at the piper and turned
to face number two 
yes! number two gazed contemptuously at ford prefect 

yes! total warfare! the war to end all wars!
but theres no one even living there yet!
ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point  in this respect his eyes were like a
couple of mosquitos that hover purposefully three inches from your nose and
refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes, fly swats or rolled newspapers 
for a moment the eyes wavered  alright  
the moment of uncertainty passed - his eyes flickered like whips over his au-
dience 
and, he roared, we interrogated a gazelle!
he flipped his kill-o-zap gun smartly under his arm and marched off through
the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the ecstatic crowd 
theyre not cavemen 
perhaps theyre having their caves redecorated, called out a wag from the
crowd 
very funny, he said, but have you noticed that theyre dying out?
on their journey back, ford and arthur had come across two derelict villages
and the bodies of many natives in the woods, where they had crept away to
die  do you know what that means?
er   we shouldnt sell them any life insurance? called out the wag again 
can you try and understand, he said, that its just since weve arrived that
theyve started dying out!
in fact that comes over terribly well in this film, said the marketing girl,
and just gives it that poignant twist which is the hallmark of the really great
documentary 
oh really? he said, coming to with a start, thats awfully nice 
hes got a very strong angle on it, you know, the burden of responsibility, the
loneliness of command  
the captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment 
well, i wouldnt overstress that angle, you know, he said finally, ones never
alone with a rubber duck 
at this point he decided he would not wait all day after all, he would merely
pretend that the last half hour hadnt happened 
fiscal policy! whooped ford prefect, fiscal policy!
the management consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish could have
copied 
how can you have money, demanded ford, if none of you actually produces
anything? it doesnt grow on trees you know 
but we have also, continued the management consultant, run into a small
inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability, which means
that, i gather, the current going rate has something like three deciduous forests
buying one ships peanut 
murmurs of alarm came from the crowd 
so in order to obviate this problem, he continued, and effectively revaluate
the leaf, we are about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign, and   i think youll all agree thats a sensible move under
the circumstances 
the crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two until some-
one pointed out how much this would increase the value of the leaves in their
pockets whereupon they let out whoops of delight and gave the management
consultant a standing ovation 
youre all mad, explained ford prefect 
youre absolutely barmy, he suggested 
youre a bunch of raving nutters, he opined 
is it perhaps in order, she demanded, to inquire what youve been doing
all these months then? you and that other interloper have been missing since
the day we arrived 
weve been on a journey, said ford, we went to try and find out something
about this planet 
oh, said the girl archly, doesnt sound very productive to me  it didnt have any  they
didnt know what he was talking about 
it doesnt matter a pair of fetid dingos kidneys what you all choose to do from
now on  two million years youve got and
thats it  remember that, two million years!

167

the crowd muttered to itself in annoyance  people as rich as they had sud-
denly become shouldnt be obliged to listen to this sort of gibberish 
they didnt need to bother  ford was already stalking out of the clearing,
pausing only to shake his head at number two who was already firing his
kill-o-zap gun into some neighbouring trees 



a mile or so away through the wood, arthur dent was too busily engrossed
with what he was doing to hear ford prefect approach 
what he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on a wide flat
piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a large square, subdivided into
one hundred and sixty-nine smaller squares, thirteen to a side 
furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish stones and
scratched the shape of a letter on to each  arthur had finally encouraged one
of them to lay a couple of stones on the board he had scratched out, which
was not even as far as hed managed to get the day before 
look, ive explained the rules to you   he suddenly had a feeling that all this might170

chapter 32  all he knew was that it had worked like a dream on him
when he was a chid 
im trying to teach the cavemen to play scrabble, he said 
theyre not cavemen, said ford 
whats that supposed to achieve? asked ford 
weve got to encourage them to evolve! to develop! arthur burst out an-
grily  it didnt  cretins
we arrived with? he said  we dont have to imagine  weve
seen it 
weve seen it, said ford, theres no escape 
did you tell them what weve discovered? he asked 
norway, said arthur, slartibartfasts signature in the glacier  did you tell
them?
whats the point? said ford, what would it mean to them?
mean? said arthur, mean? you know perfectly well what it means  why dont you tell them that? go and say
to them, excuse me, id just like to point out that in two million years time
i will be born just a few miles from here  theyll chase
you up a tree and set fire to it 
face it, said ford, those zeebs over there are your ancestors, not these poor
creatures here 
he went over to where the apemen creatures were rummaging listlessly with
the stone letters 

171

put the scrabble away, arthur, he said, it wont save the human race, be-
cause this lot arent going to be the human race 
no, said ford, theres nothing we can do  this doesnt change the history
of the earth, you see, this is the history of the earth  like it or leave it, the
golgafrinchans are the people you are descended from 
in two million years
they get destroyed by the vogons  history is never altered you see, it just fits
together like a jigsaw  funny old thing, life, isnt it?
he picked up the letter q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush where it hit
a young rabbit  the rabbit hurtled off in terror and didnt stop till it was set
upon and eaten by a fox which choked on one of its bones and died on the
bank of a stream which subsequently washed it away 
during the following weeks ford prefect swallowed his pride and struck up a
relationship with a girl who had been a personnel officer on golgafrincham,
and he was terribly upset when she suddenly passed away as a result of drink-
ing water from a pool that had been polluted by the body of a dead fox  the
only moral it is possible to draw from this story is that one should never throw
the letter q into a pivet bush, but unfortunately there are times when it is
unavoidable 
like most of the really crucial things in life, this chain of events was completely
invisible to ford prefect and arthur dent 
theyre not  
its all been a bit of waste of time for them, hasnt it? said arthur 
theyve been outevolved by telephone sanitizers 
urgh, gr gr, gruh! insisted the native, continuing to bang on the rock 
i think he probably wants you to scrabble with him again, said ford, hes

172

chapter 32 
probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor bastard 
theres only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc 
they spelt two words 
grrrurgh guh guh, explained the native  he swept the letters angrily away
and went and mooched under a nearby tree with his colleague  whats it supposed to mean?
one of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in the air, rolled over
again and went to sleep 
the other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts at ford prefect  that means that these natives, these apemen are an integral part
of the computer program, and that we and the golgafrinchans are not 
but the cavemen are dying out and the golgafrinchans are obviously set to
replace them  so do you see what this means?
what?
cock up, said ford prefect  i dont see how we can though 
they moped about for a bit  arthur sat on the ground and started pulling
up bits of grass, but found that it wasnt an occupation he could get deeply
engrossed in  it wasnt grass he could believe in, the trees seemed pointless,
the rolling hills seemed to be rolling to nowhere and the future seemed just a
tunnel to be crawled through 
ford fiddled with his sub-etha sens-o-matic 
arthur picked up one of the letter stones from his home-made scrabble set  that spelt it  he hadnt done it deliberately, it was just a
random chance 
ford, he said suddenly, look, if that question is printed in my brain wave
patterns but im not consciously aware of it it must be somewhere in my un-
conscious 
oh yes?
yes, by introducing some random element that can be shaped by that pat-
tern 
like how?
like by pulling scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded  he tugged his towel out of his satchel and with a few deft
knots transformed it into a bag 
arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful of stones  he
jiggled them about, pulled out four and handed them to ford  doy  oh perhaps it isnt working, said ford 
heres the next three  doyoug   its not making sense im afraid 
e, t, doyouget   come on, wheres
the next one?
er, thats the lot, said arthur, thats all there were 
he sat back, nonplussed 
you mean thats it? said ford 
thats it 
thats it  thats all there is 



the sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them  a warm
breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the flowers, carrying
their scent away through the woods  an insect droned past on its way to do
whatever it is that insects do in the late afternoon  the sound of voices lilted
through the trees followed a moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise
at the sight of ford prefect and arthur dent apparently lying on the ground
in agony, but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter 
no, dont go, called ford prefect between gasps, well be with you in a
moment 
whats the matter? asked one of the girls  on golgafrincham she had been a junior personnel officer, but
hadnt liked it much 
yes, what was all that for? asked the other girl, a shorter round-faced girl
who had been an art director for a small advertising company on golgafrin-
cham  whatever the privations of this world were, she went to sleep every
night profoundly grateful for the fact that whatever she had to face in the
morning it wouldnt be a hundred almost identical photographs of moodily lit
tubes of toothpaste  nothings for anything, said ford prefect happily  im ford, this is arthur 

im agda, said the tall one, this is mella 
do you talk at all? said mella to arthur 
what did you mean, asked agda, about only having two million years? i
couldnt make sense of what you were saying 
oh that, said ford, it doesnt matter 
its just that the world gets demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass,
said arthur with a shrug, but thats two million years away, and anyway its
just vogons doing what vogons do 
vogons? said mella 
yes, you wouldnt know them 
whered you get this idea from?
it really doesnt matter 
does it worry you that you dont talk any kind of sense? asked agda 
oh, ive heard of worse, said ford, i read of one planet off in the seventh
dimension that got used as a ball in a game of intergalactic bar billiards 
thats mad, said mella 
agda and mella exchanged glances 
look, said agda, theres a party after the committee meeting tonight 
id like to, said arthur 
many hours later arthur and mella sat and watched the moon rise over the
dull red glow of the trees  began mella 

177

youre very strange, she said 
no, im very ordinary, said arthur, but some very strange things have hap-
pened to me  you could say im more differed from than differing 
ah, that i dont know about 
the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy, he said at last 
whats that?
oh, just something i threw into the river this evening  i dont think ill be
wanting it any more, said arthur dent 
it wasnt just that the cave was cold, it wasnt just that it was damp and
smelly  it was the fact that the cave was in the middle of islington and there
wasnt a bus due for two million years 
he hadnt been blown up now for five years 
since he had hardly seen anyone since he and ford prefect had parted com-
pany four years previously, he hadnt been insulted in all that time either  the castaways im-
possible dream - a ship 
it alighted gently on the ground, and what little hum it had generated died
away, as if lulled by the evening calm  it walked down the ramp4

and stood in front of arthur 
youre a jerk, dent, it said simply 
it had a peculiar alien tallness, a peculiar alien
flattened head, peculiar slitty little alien eyes, extravagantly draped golden
ropes with a peculiarly alien collar design, and pale grey-green alien skin which
had about it that lustrous shine which most grey-green faces can only acquire
with plenty of exercise and very expensive soap 
it gazed levelly at him 
arthurs first sensations of hope and trepidation had instantly been over-
whelmed by astonishment, and all sorts of thoughts were battling for the use
of his vocal chords at this moment 
whh  
bu   hu  
ru   wah  
the alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to be some
species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and spindly alien hand 
arthur philip dent? pursued the alien in a kind of efficient yap 
er   er   er  
youre a jerk, repeated the alien, a complete asshole 
er  
the creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on its clipboard and
turned briskly back towards the ship 
er   said arthur desperately, er  
dont give me that! snapped the alien  his name was wowbagger the infinitely prolonged 
wowbagger the infinitely prolonged was indeed, is - one of the universes
very small number of immortal beings 
those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with it, but
wowbagger was not one of them 
wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim and weary expression, put some light jazz
on the ships stereo, and reflected that he could have made it if it hadnt been
for sunday afternoons, he really could have done 
to begin with it was fun, he had a ball, living dangerously, taking risks, clean-
ing up on high-yield long-term investments, and just generally outliving the
hell out of everybody 
in the end, it was the sunday afternoons he couldnt cope with, and that terri-
ble listlessness which starts to set in at about 2 55, when you know that youve
had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare
at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use
the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare
at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four oclock, and you will
enter the long dark teatime of the soul  he equipped a spaceship that was built to last with the
computer capable of handling all the data processing involved in keeping track
of the entire population of the known universe and working out the horrifically
complicated routes involved 
here, yipped the computer 
wowbagger gazed for a moment at the fantastic jewellery of the night, the
billions of tiny diamond worlds that dusted the infinite darkness with light 
he imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots in the sky
like a childs numbered dots puzzle 
the computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it had finished its calcula-
tions  it beeped 
fourth world of the folfanga system, it continued  it beeped again  it beeped again 
there to meet with a small slug, it beeped, of the genus a- rth-urp-hil-
ipdenu 
i believe, it added, after a slight pause during which it beeped, that you
had decided to call it a brainless prat 
wowbagger grunted 
i think ill take a nap, he said, and then added, what network areas are we
going to be passing through in the next few hours?
the computer beeped 
cosmovid, thinkpix and home brain box, it said, and beeped 
any movies i havent seen thirty thousand times already?
no 
theres angst in space  youve only seen that thirty-three thousand five
hundred and seventeen times 
the computer beeped 
meanwhile, on earth, it began to pour with rain and arthur dent sat in his
cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of his entire life, thinking
of things he could have said to the alien and swatting flies, who also had a
rotten evening 
though his throat was sore again from his early morning yell of horror, he was
suddenly in a terrifically good mood  he wrapped his dilapidated dressing
gown tightly around him and beamed at the bright morning 
the air was clear and scented, the breeze flitted lightly through the tall grass
around his cave, the birds were chirruping at each other, the butterflies were
flitting about prettily, and the whole of nature seemed to be conspiring to be
as pleasant as it possibly could 
it wasnt all the pastoral delights that were making arthur feel so cheery,
though  he had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope with the terrible
lonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his attempts at horticulture,
and the sheer futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric earth,
which was that he would go mad 
he beamed again and took a bite out of a rabbit leg left over from his supper 
arthurs brain somersaulted 
where have you been? interrupted arthur, now that his head had finished10

chapter 1 
he took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel his sub-etha
sens-o-matic 
carry on, he said levelly  i ask merely for informa-
tion 
very nice, said ford, in reference to arthurs cave 
arthur didnt bother to reply  but you may be interested to know that i am singlehandedly
responsible for the evolved shape of the animal you came to know in later
centuries as a giraffe  the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy 
yes, said ford, but i fished it out 
you didnt tell me 
i didnt want you to throw it in again 
i havent done very well so far, he said  im very
glad to see you again, arthur, he added 
i havent seen anyone for years, he said, not anyone  i practise you see  i practise
by talking to   what are those things people think youre mad
if you talk to? like george the third  ive planted hundreds myself  trees! i
practise by talking to trees  whats that for?
ford still had his hand stuck out  they climbed to the top
of a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene around them 
a lot of them didnt make it through the winter three years ago, he said,
and the few who remained in the spring said they needed a holiday and set
off on a raft 
i dont know, said ford, but i just feel that the time is right 
arthur asked him to repeat what he had just said because he hadnt quite
taken his meaning 
the space-time wash, said ford, and as the wind blew briefly past at that
moment, he bared his teeth into it 
are we talking about, he asked cautiously, some sort of vogon laundromat,
or what are we talking about?
eddies, said ford, in the space-time continuum 
ah, nodded arthur, is he? is he? he pushed his hands into the pocket of
his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the distance 
i have been listening, said arthur, but im not sure its helped 

13

arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing gown where ford was hold-
ing it 
has it? said arthur, his eyes not wavering for a moment 
the difficulty with this conversation, said arthur after a sort of pondering
look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer negotiating a tricky
outcrop, is that its very different from most of the ones ive had of late  they werent like this 
except perhaps some of the ones ive had with elms which sometimes get a
bit bogged down 
ah, well im not sure i believe that  it was making vague humming noises
and a tiny light on it was flickering faintly  much to his surprise, there was a velvet paisley- covered
chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them 
arthur! shouted ford at him, that sofa is there because of the space-time
instability ive been trying to get your terminally softened brain to get to grips
with  its been washed out of the continuum, its space-time jetsam, it doesnt
matter what it is, weve got to catch it, its our only way out of here!
he scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made off across the field 
catch it? muttered arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he saw that the
chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across the grass 
with a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and
plunged off in hectic pursuit of ford prefect and the irrational piece of furni-
ture 
they careered wildly through the grass, leaping, laughing, shouting instruc-
tions to each other to head the thing off this way or that way  the sun shone
dreamily on the swaying grass, tiny field animals scattered crazily in their
wake  only twenty minutes ago he had decided he
would go mad, and now he was already chasing a chesterfield sofa across the
fields of prehistoric earth 
the sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be as solid
as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as a billowing dream as
it floated like a ghost through others 
ford and arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it dodged and weaved as if
following its own complex mathematical topography, which it was  still they
pursued, still it danced and span, and suddenly turned and dipped as if cross-
ing the lip of a catastrophe graph, and they were practically on top of it  with
a heave and a shout they leapt on it, the sun winked out, they fell through a
sickening nothingness, and emerged unexpectedly in the middle of the pitch at
lords cricked ground, st johns wood, london, towards the end of the last
test match of the australian series in the year 198-, with england needing
only twenty-eight runs to win 



important facts from galactic history, number one:
(reproduced from the siderial daily mentioners book of popular galactic
history )
the night sky over the planet krikkit is the least interesting sight in the entire
universe  it wasnt for them, but instinc-
tively they bowed anyway, which was fortunate because the small red heavy
ball which the crowd actually had been applauding whistled mere millimetres
over arthurs head  he leapt to his feet like
an author hearing the phone ring and shot a series of startled glanced at the
panorama around him which had suddenly settled down into something of
quite terrifying ordinariness 
this is lords cricket ground, isnt it? snapped arthur 
youve been dreaming for the last five years, he said  ive been dreaming for the last five years 
having said this, he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch, brushing down
his dressing gown 
hes had a bad two million years, he said to the policeman, and together
they heaved arthur on to the sofa and carried him off the pitch and were only
briefly hampered by the sudden disappearance of the sofa on the way  most of them
couldnt cope with watching it, and listened to it on the radio instead  i dont think there have been any mysterious materializations on
the pitch since, oh since, well i dont think there have been any - have there?
- that i recall?
edgbaston, 1932?
ah, now what happened then   he said, yes, theres nothing actually very mysterious about
that, is there? he didnt actually materialize, did he? just ran on 
no, thats true, but he did claim to have seen something materialize on the
pitch 
and what happened to the man?
well, i think someone offered to take him off and give him some lunch, but he
explained that hed already had a rather good one, so the matter was dropped
and warwickshire went on to win by three wickets  for those of you whove just tuned
in, you may be interested to know that, er   two men, two rather scruffily
attired men, and indeed a sofa - a chesterfield i think?
yes, a chesterfield  but i
dont think they meant any harm, theyve been very good-natured about it,
and   well, thats one mystery less  the men are leaving the
pitch in the company of a police officer, and i think everyones settling down
now and play is about to resume 
now, sir, said the policeman after they had made a passage through the
curious crowd and laid arthurs peacefully inert body on a blanket, perhaps
youd care to tell me who you are, where you come from, and what that little
scene was all about?
ford looked at the ground for a moment as if steadying himself for something,
then he straightened up and aimed a look at the policeman which hit him
with the full force of every inch of the six hundred light-years distance be-
tween earth and fords home near betelgeuse 
yes, well, that wont be necessary, said the policeman hurriedly, just dont
let whatever it was happen again  the policeman turned around and wan-
dered off in search of anyone who wasnt from betelgeuse 

arthurs consciousness approached his body as from a great distance, and re-
luctantly 
ten minutes later, hunched over a cup of tea in the refreshment tent, the colour
started to come back to his haggard face 
howre you feeling? said ford 
im home, said arthur hoarsely  he closed his eyes and greedily inhaled the
steam from his tea as if it was - well, as far as arthur was concerned, as if it
was tea, which it was 
im home, he repeated, home  im where i belong, he
said in an emotional whisper 
im home, said arthur 
im home, said arthur  tea, he said, cricket, he added with pleasure,
mown grass, wooden benches, white linen jackets, beer cans  
ive seen that one before, he said  his face froze for a second or two and then
began to do that terribly slow crashing trick which arctic ice-floes do so spec-
tacularly in the spring  it shone on ice lollies and melted them  it shone
on the tears of small children whose ice lollies had just melted and fallen off
the stick  it beamed on ford and arthur
as they emerged blinking from the refreshment tent and surveyed the scene
around them 
dont try and phone yourself up at home  he picked up an imaginary phone and dialled an imaginary
dial  dont hang up 
a glummer look replaced the already glum look on arthur dents face 
we could not even be said, replied ford, to be home and vigorously tow-
elling ourselves off  the bowler approached the wicket at a lope, a trot,
and then a run  the batsman swung and thwacked it behind him over the
sight-screens  fords eyes followed the trajectory of the ball and jogged mo-
mentarily 
this isnt my towel, said arthur, who was rummaging in his rabbit-skin bag 
i had a golgafrinchan jogging towel, continued arthur, it was blue with
yellow stars on it  this isnt it 
this ones pink, said arthur, it isnt yours is it?
i would like you to shut up about your towel, said ford 
it isnt my towel, insisted arthur, that is the point i am trying to  
all right, said arthur, starting to stuff it back into the primitively stitched

22

chapter 3  i realize that it is probably not important in the cosmic scale
of things, its just odd, thats all 
ford was beginning to behave rather strangely, or rather not actually begin-
ning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in a way which was strangely
different from the other strange ways in which he more regularly behaved  regardless of the bemused stares it was pro-
voking from his fellow members of the crowd gathered round the pitch, he
was waving his hands in sharp movements across his face, ducking down be-
hind some people, leaping up behind others, then standing still and blinking
a lot  after a moment or two of this he started to stalk forward slowly and
stealthily wearing a puzzled frown of concentration, like a leopard thats not
sure whether its just seen a half-empty tin of cat food half a mile away across
a hot and dusty plain 
this isnt my bag either, said arthur suddenly 
i wasnt talking about my towel, said arthur  weve established that that
isnt mine  the cricket ball which
had excited this reaction fell out of the sky and dropped neatly into arthurs
mysterious rabbit-skin bag 
i dont think its here, he said to the small boys who immediately clustered
round him to join in the search, it probably rolled off somewhere  one of the boys looked at him quizzically 
im training it to like being wherever its put  arthur prided himself on say-
ing this 

23

whats your name?
dent, said arthur, arthur dent 
youre a jerk, dent, said the boy, a complete asshole  the boy looked
past him at something else, to show that he wasnt in any particular hurry
to run away, and then wandered off scratching his nose  suddenly arthur re-
membered that the earth was going to be demolished again in two days time,
and just this once didnt feel too bad about it 
somethings on your mind, isnt it? said arthur 
i think, said ford in a tone of voice which arthur by now recognized as one
which presaged something utterly unintelligible, that theres an sep over
there 
an sep  ep 
and whats that?
somebody elses problem  it wasnt 
i see, said arthur, who didnt 
can you see, said ford patiently, the sep?
i thought you said that was somebody elses problem 
thats right 
an sep, he said, is something that we cant see, or dont see, or our brain
doesnt let us see, because we think that its somebody elses problem  thats
what sep means  somebody elses problem  the brain just edits it out, its
like a blind spot 
ah, said arthur, then thats why   youve been jumping up and  
i think youve got the message 
a roar erupted from the crowd, and from every direction people were run-
ning, shouting, yelling, tumbling over each other in a tumult of confusion 
exciting, isnt it? said an apparition  the apparition wobbled in front of
arthurs eyes, though the truth of the matter is probably that arthurs eyes
were wobbling in front of the apparition  repeated arthur, and punctuated each wobble with a
prod at ford prefects back  ford was staring at the tumult in trepidation 
you are english, arent you? said the apparition  i must say, im rather fond of cricket,
though i wouldnt like anyone outside this planet to hear me saying that 
still, he said, itll all be over in a couple of days, wont it? though as i
said to you when we last met, i was very sorry about that 
i know that, said slartibartfast 
hello, earthman, said slartibartfast 
the old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch, with eyes that
seemed alive with expressions that had no apparent bearing on what was hap-
pening out there  what slartibartfast saw in it,
he alone knew 

its just, he burst out at last, that if we dont go soon, we might get caught
in the middle of it all again  and theres nothing that depresses me more
than seeing a planet being destroyed 
patience, said slartibartfast again 
thats what you said last time we met, said arthur 
they were, said slartibartfast 
yes, thats true, admitted arthur 
he fretted as he heard it explained that the ashes were about to be presented
to the captain of the english team out there on the pitch, fumed when told
that this was because they had now won them for the nth time, positively
barked with annoyance at the information that the ashes were the remains of
a cricket stump, and when, further to this, he was asked to contend with the
fact that the cricket stump in question had been burnt in melbourne, australia,
in 1882, to signify the death of english cricket, he rounded on slartibartfast,
took a deep breath, but didnt have a chance to say anything because the old
man wasnt there 
what in the name of zarking fardwarks is the old fool doing? exploded ford 
meeting us at his ship in two minutes, said arthur with a shrug which in-
dicated total abdication of thought  they tried not to listen, but could not help notic-
ing that slartibartfast was querulously demanding that he be given the silver
urn containing the ashes, as they were, he said, vitally important for the
past, present and future safety of the galaxy, and that this was causing wild
hilarity  i dont want to know, i dont want to see, i
dont want to hear, he yelled as he ran, this is not my planet, i didnt choose
to be here, i dont want to get involved, just get me out of here, and get me
to a party, with people i can relate to!
smoke and flame billowed from the pitch  burbled a radio happily to itself  he continued to run, pausing only for a mo-
ment to grab arthurs arm and drag him along with him 
theyre playing cricket, muttered arthur, stumbling along after ford  theyre not just killing people, theyre sending
them up, he shouted, ford, theyre sending us up!
it would have been hard to disbelieve this without knowing a great deal more
galactic history than arthur had so far managed to pick up in his travels 
the ghostly but violent shapes that could be seen moving within the thick
pall of smoke seemed to be performing a series of bizarre parodies of batting
strokes, the difference being that every ball they struck with their bats ex-
ploded wherever it landed  the very first one of these had dispelled arthurs
initial reaction, that the whole thing might just be a publicity stunt by aus-
tralian margarine manufacturers  the eleven white
robots ascended through the seething cloud in a tight formation, and with a
few last flashes of flame entered the bowels of their hovering white ship, which,
with the noise of a hundred thousand people saying foop, promptly vanished

28

chapter 3 

into the thin air out of which it had wopped 
for a moment there was a terrible stunned silence, and then out of the drifting
smoke emerged the pale figure of slartibartfast looking even more like moses
because in spite of the continued absence of the mountain he was at least now
striding across a fiery and smoking well-mown lawn 
he stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying figures of arthur dent
and ford prefect forcing their way through the frightened crowd which was
for the moment busy stampeding in the opposite direction 
slartibartfast was gesturing urgently at ford and arthur and shouting at them,
as the three of them gradually converged on his ship, still parked behind the
sight-screens and still apparently unnoticed by the crowd stampeding past it
who presumably had enough of their own problems to cope with at that time 
theyve garble warble farble! shouted slartibartfast in his thin tremulous
voice 
what did he say? panted ford as he elbowed his way onwards 
theyve  
theyve table warble farble! shouted slartibartfast again 
what?
theyve garble warble fashes! cried slartibartfast, still waving at them 
he says, said arthur, that theyve taken the ashes  the second strangest thing about the ship was watch-
ing the somebody elses problem field at work  this wasnt because it was actu-
ally invisible or anything hyper-impossible like that  the ultra-famous sciento-magician effrafax of wug once bet
his life that, given a year, he could render the great megamountain magramal
entirely invisible 
having spent most of the year jiggling around with immense lux- o-valves
and refracto-nullifiers and spectrum-bypass-o-matics, he realized, with nine
hours to go, that he wasnt going to make it 
so, he and his friends, and his friends friends, and his friends friends friends,
and his friends friends friends friends, and some rather less good friends of
theirs who happened to own a major stellar trucking company, put in what
now is widely recognized as being the hardest nights work in history, and, sure
enough, on the following day, magramal was no longer visible  effrafax lost his
bet - and therefore his life - simply because some pedantic adjudicating official
noticed (a) that when walking around the area that magramal ought to be he
didnt trip over or break his nose on anything, and (b) a suspicious-looking
extra moon 
the somebody elses problem field is much simpler and more effective, and
whats more can be run for over a hundred years on a single torch battery 
this is because it relies on peoples natural disposition not to see anything they
dont want to, werent expecting, or cant explain  if effrafax had painted the
mountain pink and erected a cheap and simple somebody elses problem field
on it, then people would have walked past the mountain, round it, even over
it, and simply never have noticed that the thing was there 
and this is precisely what was happening with slartibartfasts ship  it wasnt
pink, but if it had been, that would have been the least of its visual problems
and people were simply ignoring it like anything 
the most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly like a
spaceship with guidance fins, rocket engines and escape hatches and so on,
and a great deal like a small upended italian bistro 
ford and arthur gazed up at it with wonderment and deeply offended sensi-
bilities 
ford and arthur followed slartibartfast into the ship and were so perplexed
by what they saw inside it that they were totally unaware of what happened
next outside 
youre a no-good dumbo nothing, whispered the creature 



important facts from galactic history, number two:
(reproduced from the siderial daily mentioners book of popular galactic
history )
since this galaxy began, vast civilizations have risen and fallen, risen and
fallen, risen and fallen so often that its quite tempting to think that life in
the galaxy must be
(a) something akin to seasick - space-sick, time sick, history sick or some such
thing, and
(b) stupid 
it seemed to the people at lords cricket ground that another north london
restaurant had just come and gone as they so often do, and that this was
somebody elses problem 
we took off, said slartibartfast  he wasnt certain
whether he had just got space-sickness or religion 
nice mover, said ford in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the degree
to which he had been impressed by what slartibartfasts ship had just done,
shame about the decor 
for a moment or two the old man didnt reply  he was staring at the instru-
ments with the air of one who is trying to convert fahrenheit to centigrade in
his head whilst his house is burning down  then his brow cleared and he stared
for a moment at the wide panoramic screen in front of him, which displayed a
bewildering complexity of stars streaming like silver threads around them 
its a mistake to try and understand mathematics, he said, they only worry34

chapter 5 
the interior of the flight deck was dark green, dark red, dark brown, cramped
and moodily lit  inexplicably, the resemblance to a small italian bistro had
failed to end at the hatchway  small pools of light picked out pot plants, glazed
tiles and all sorts of little unidentifiable brass things 
the instruments which had occupied slartibartfasts attention seemed to be
mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in concrete  he looked at the screen and rec-
ognized nothing  he looked at slartibartfast  said slartibartfast, about two thirds of the way across the galac-
tic disc, i would say, roughly  look, theres somewhere you can take us where we can have fun, im
trying to think of it, we can get drunk and maybe listen to some extremely
evil music  he dug out his copy of the hitch hikers
guide to the galaxy and tipped through those parts of the index primarily
concerned with sex and drugs and rock and roll 
a curse has arisen from the mists of time, said slartibartfast  hey, he said, lighting accidentally on one par-

start some four miles from her actual body 
a curse, said slartibartfast, which will engulf the galaxy in fire and de-
struction, and possibly bring the universe to a premature doom  here, he said, stabbing his finger at the screen of the guide, would
be a really wicked place to go, and i think we should  what do you say,
arthur? stop mumbling mantras and pay attention  theres important stuff
youre missing here  is that an idea you can cope with?
whats slartibartfast looking so anxious about? said arthur 
doom, said slartibartfast 
he walked towards a green wrought-iron spiral staircase set incomprehensibly
in the middle of the flight deck and started to ascend 
ford slung the guide sullenly back into his satchel 
my doctor says that i have a malformed public-duty gland and a natural
deficiency in moral fibre, he muttered to himself, and that i am therefore
excused from saving universes 
the central computational area, said slartibartfast unperturbed, this is
where every calculation affecting the ship in any way is performed  around it were gathered about a dozen chairs,
of the bentwood style  on it was a tablecloth - a grubby, red and white check
tablecloth, scarred with the occasional cigarette burn, each, presumably, at a
precise calculated mathematical position 
and on the tablecloth sat some half-eaten italian meals, hedged about with
half-eaten breadsticks and half-drunk glasses of wine, and toyed with listlessly
by robots  the robot customers were attended by a robot
waiter, a robot wine waiter and a robot maetre d  the furniture was artificial,
the tablecloth artificial, and each particular piece of food was clearly capable
of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics of, say, a pollo sorpreso, with-
out actually being one 
and all participated in a little dance together - a complex routine involving the
manipulation of menus, bill pads, wallets, cheque books, credit cards, watches,
pencils and paper napkins, which seemed to be hovering constantly on the
edge of violence, but never actually getting anywhere 
slartibartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time of day quite idly
with the maetre d, whilst one of the customer robots, an autorory, slid slowly
under the table, mentioning what he intended to do to some guy over some
girl 
slartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and passed a
shrewd eye over the menu  soon, an ex-
traordinary and insistent politeness overwhelmed the group, and seconds later
it seemed that a moment of consensus was suddenly achieved 
slartibartfast emerged from the glass room  the most powerful computational force known to
parascience 



the bistromatic drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar
distances without all that dangerous mucking about with improbability fac-
tors 
bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the
behaviour of numbers  just as einstein observed that time was not an absolute
but depended on the observers movement in space, and that space was not an
absolute, but depended on the observers movement in time, so it is now real-
ized that numbers are not absolute, but depend on the observers movement
in restaurants  re-
cipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of maths, including
statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer
the somebody elses problem field 
the third and most mysterious piece of non-absoluteness of all lies in the re-
lationship between the number of items on the bill, the cost of each item, the
number of people at the table, and what they are each prepared to pay for 

the baffling discrepancies which used to occur at this point remained uninves-
tigated for centuries simply because no one took them seriously  they were at
the time put down to such things as politeness, rudeness, meanness, flashness,
tiredness, emotionality, or the lateness of the hour, and completely forgotten
about on the following morning  they were never tested under laboratory
conditions, of course, because they never occurred in laboratories - not in rep-
utable laboratories at least  it completely revolution-
ized it  so many mathematical conferences got held in such good restaurants
that many of the finest minds of a generation died of obesity and heart failure
and the science of maths was put back by years  then
some phrases like interactive subjectivity frameworks were invented, and
everybody was able to relax and get on with it 



in space travel, you see, said slartibartfast, as he fiddled with some instru-
ments in the room of informational illusions, in space travel  
the room of informational illusions was a welcome relief after the visual mon-
strosities of the central computational area  no infor-
mation, no illusions, just themselves, white walls and a few small instruments
which looked as if they were meant to plug into something which slartibartfast
couldnt find  he had picked up slartibartfasts sense of urgency but
didnt know what to do with it 
you were saying?
slartibartfast looked at him sharply  after a while he realized that this wasnt
getting him anywhere and decided that he would say what? after all 
arthur nodded again and looked round to ford for help, but ford was prac-
tising being sullen and getting quite good at it 
i was only, said slartibartfast with a sigh, trying to save you the trouble of
asking me why all the ships computations were being done on a waiters bill
pad 
slartibartfast said, because in space travel all the numbers are awful 
he could tell that he wasnt getting his point across  you must have40

chapter 7 
on a waiters bill pad, said slartibartfast, reality and unreality collide on
such a fundamental level that each becomes the other and anything is possible,
within certain parameters 
what parameters?
its impossible to say, said slartibartfast  thats one of them  at least, i think its strange, he added, and im assured that its true 
they didnt hear what he said, because at that moment the ship winked out
of existence around them and a starbattle-ship the size of a small midlands
industrial city plunged out of the sundered night towards them, star lasers
ablaze 
the early mornings thinnest sliver of light appeared silently 
several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen nuclei rose slowly
above the horizon and managed to look small, cold and slightly damp 
the moment passed as it regularly did on squornshellous zeta, without inci-
dent  the swamp trees were grey with
it, the tall reeds indistinct 
very often on squornshellous zeta, whole days would go on like this, and this
was indeed going to be one of them  a mattress had just met a
robot 
hello, robot, said the mattress 
happy? said the mattress 
the robot stopped and looked at the mattress  it looked at it quizzically  it
was clearly a very stupid mattress  a forest
was discovered recently in which most of the trees grew ratchet screwdrivers
as fruit  the life cycle of ratchet screwdriver fruit it quite interesting 
then one night it suddenly hatches, discards its outer skin which crumbles into
dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable little metal object with flanges
at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of hole for a screw 
they are large, friendly, pocket-sprung creatures which live quiet private lives
in the marshes of squornshellous zeta  none of them seem to mind and all of
them are called zem 
my name, said the mattress, is zem 
if he had had
teeth he would have gritted them at this point  he hadnt  he didnt 
the mattress flolloped around 
it flolloped in a sympathetic sort of way, moving a fairish body of water as it
did so  its blue and
white stripes glistened briefly in a sudden feeble ray of sun that had unexpect-

43

edly made it through the mist, causing the creature to bask momentarily 
you have something on your mind, i think, said the mattress floopily 
my capacity for happiness, he added, you could fit into a matchbox with-
out taking out the matches first 
the mattress globbered  this is the noise made by a live, swamp- dwelling
mattress that is deeply moved by a story of personal tragedy  the word can
also, according to the ultra-complete maximegalon dictionary of every lan-
guage ever, mean the noise made by the lord high sanvalvwag of hollop on
discovering that he has forgotten his wifes birthday for the second year run-
ning  since there was only ever one lord high sanvalvwag of hollop, and he
never married, the word is only ever used in a negative or speculative sense,
and there is an ever-increasing body of opinion which holds that the ultra-
complete maximegalon dictionary is not worth the fleet of lorries it takes to
cart its microstored edition around in  strangely enough, the dictionary omits
the word floopily, which simply means in the manner of something which
is floopy 
the mattress globbered again 
i sense a deep dejection in your diodes, it vollued (for the meaning of the
word vollue, buy a copy of squornshellous swamptalk at any remaindered
bookshop, or alternatively buy the ultra-complete maximegalon dictionary,
as the university will be very glad to get it off their hands and regain some
valuable parking lots), and it saddens me  you should be more mattresslike 
we live quiet retired lives in the swamp, where we are content to flollop and
vollue and regard the wetness in a fairly floopy manner  some of us are killed,
but all of us are called zem, so we never know which and globbering is thus
kept to a minimum 
it seems to me, said the mattress eyeing it compassionately, that it is a
pretty poor sort of leg 
voon, said the mattress  you should tell your friends zem and
zem when you see them later; theyll laugh, if i know them, which i dont of
course - except insofar as i know all organic life forms, which is much better

44

chapter 8  ha, but my life is but a box of wormgears 
but why do you just keep walking round and round? said the mattress 
consider it made, my dear friend, flurbled the mattress, consider it made 
the mattress could feel deep in his innermost spring pockets that the robot
dearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging in this futile and
fruitless manner, and with another quiet flurble he did so 
the mattress did 
i gave a speech once, he said suddenly, and apparently unconnectedly  you
may not instantly see why i bring the subject up, but that is because my mind
works so phenomenally fast, and i am at a rough estimate thirty billion times
more intelligent than you 
er, five, said the mattress  you see?
the mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it was in the pres-
ence of a not unremarkable mind  it willomied along its entire length, sending
excited little ripples through its shallow algae-covered pool 
it gupped  i delivered
it, he added, pausing to make an awkward humping sort of gesture with his
not-exactly-good arm, but his arm which was better than the other one which
was dishearteningly welded to his left side, over there, about a mile distance 
excitement gripped the mattress  it had never heard of speeches being deliv-
ered on squornshellous zeta, and certainly not by celebrities  water spattered
off it as a thrill glurried across its back  summoning every

45

bit of its strength, it reared its oblong body, heaved it up into the air and held
it quivering there for a few seconds whilst it peered through the mist over the
reeds at the part of the marsh which marvin had indicated, observing, without
disappointment, that it was exactly the same as every other part of the marsh 
the effort was too much, and it flodged back into its pool, deluging marvin
with smelly mud, moss and weeds 
i was a celebrity, droned the robot sadly, for a short while on account of my
miraculous and bitterly resented escape from a fate almost as good as death in
the heart of a blazing sun  hateful, isnt it? he sold me to a
mind zoo  i had to sit on a box and tell my story whilst
people told me to cheer up and think positive 
the speech, urged the mattress  a cyberstructured hyper-
bridge, hundreds of miles in length, to carry ion-buggies and freighters over
the swamp 
a bridge? quirruled the mattress  it was going to revitalize
the economy of the squornshellous system  they spent the entire economy of
the squornshellous system building it 
did it glitter? enthused the mattress  do you want to hear this story?
i want to hear your speech, said the mattress 

this hapless cyberstructure open to the unthinkable abuse of all who wantonly
cross her 
the mattress flurred and glurried  it flolloped, gupped and willomied, doing
this last in a particularly floopy way 
voon, it wurfed at last  for a sudden violent moment they were
all there, in the swamp, wrenching marvins false leg off, and then they were
gone again in their ship, which said foop 
you see the sort of thing i have to contend with? said marvin to the gob-
bering mattress 
suddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for another violent inci-
dent, and this time when they left, the mattress was alone in the swamp  he
flolloped around in astonishment and alarm  he almost lurgled in fear  he
reared himself to see over the reeds, but there was nothing to see, just more
reeds  he listened, but there was no sound on the wind beyond the now famil-
iar sound of half-crazed etymologists calling distantly to each other across the
sullen mire 
the universe shattered into a million glittering fragments around it, and each
particular shard span silently through the void, reflecting on its silver surface
some single searing holocaust of fire and destruction 
these, then, said the figure, speaking from an immensely comfortable chair,
were the krikkit wars, the greatest devastation ever visited upon our galaxy 
slartibartfast floated past, waving  terribly
sorry, trying to find the rewind control  
do not, called out slartibartfast floating past again, and fiddling furiously
with the thing that he had stuck into the wall of the room of informational
illusions and which was in fact still stuck there, agree to buy anything at this
point  and let us not forget - and in just a moment i shall be
able to suggest a way which will help us always to remember - that before the
krikkit wars, the galaxy was that rare and wonderful thing a happy galaxy!48

chapter 9 
a happy galaxy, my friends, as represented by the symbol of the wikkit
gate!
the three pillars stood out clearly now, three pillars topped with two cross
pieces in a way which looked stupefyingly familiar to arthurs addled brain  the steel pillar which represented
the strength and power of the galaxy!
searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and down the pillar on
the left which was, clearly, made of steel or something very like it 
the perspex pillar, announced the man, representing the forces of science
and reason in the galaxy!
other searchlights played exotically up and down the righthand, transparent
pillar creating dazzling patterns within it and a sudden inexplicable craving
for ice-cream in the stomach of arthur dent  the music moved bravely up into the
realms of complete unspeakability  at the top
of the three pillars the two brilliantly gleaming bails sat and dazzled  this it was that the forces of krikkit de-
stroyed, and this it is that now locks their world away till the end of eternity!
and with a flourish, the man produced in his hands a model of the wikkit
gate 
slartibartfast floated past again at this moment  just dont nod, thats all 
lights came and went, the pillars disappeared, the man gabled himself back-
wards into nothing, the universe snappily reassembled itself around them 
you get the gist? said slartibartfast 
im astonished, said arthur, and bewildered  did i miss
anything?
they found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on the edge of an
agonizingly high cliff  the sky was a sullen pink, darkening via a rather curious colour to
blue and upwards to black 
events were now passing back by them almost too quickly to be distinguished,
and when, a short while later, a huge starbattle- ship rushed away from them
as if theyd said boo, they only just recognized it as the point at which they
had come in 
but now things were too rapid, a video-tactile blur which brushed and jiggled
them through centuries of galactic history, turning, twisting, flickering 
periodically through the thickening jumble of events they sensed appalling
catastrophes, deep horrors, cataclysmic shocks, and these were always asso-
ciated with certain recurring images, the only images which ever stood out
clearly from the avalance of tumbling history: a wicket gate, a small hard red
ball, hard white robots, and also something less distinct, something dark and
cloudy 
just as a slow series of clicks when speeded up will lose the definition of each
individual click and gradually take on the quality of a sustained and rising
tone, so a series of individual impressions here took on the quality of a sus-
tained emotion - and yet not an emotion  if it was an emotion, it was a totally
emotionless one  and it was deadly - again, not like a bullet or a knife is deadly,
but like a brick wall across a motorway is deadly 
and just as a rising tone will change in character and take on harmonics as
it rises, so again, this emotionless emotion seemed to rise to an unbearable if
unheard scream and suddenly seemed to be a scream of guilt and failure 
they were left standing on a quiet hilltop on a tranquil evening  a little way away could be heard the sound of children
playing, and a little further away than the apparent source of that sound could
be seen in the dimming evening light the outlines of a small town  slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it
stopped  slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it stopped  they
walked a short way in the direction of the town, and the informational illusion
of the grass was pleasant and springy under their feet, and the informational
illusion of the flowers smelt sweet and fragrant  only slartibartfast seemed
apprehensive and out of sorts 
it suddenly occurred to arthur that, coming as this did at the end, so to speak,
or rather the beginning of all the horror they had just blurredly experienced,
something nasty must be about to happen 
theyre not about to attack here, are they? he said 
nothing is about to attack here, said slartibartfast in a voice which unex-
pectedly trembled with emotion  this is krikkit

i said zark off 
stomp stomp stomp stomp 
zaphod stopped stomping  it was
drifting in a remote area of the galaxy, deep in the inky blackness of space 
so which particular hundred thousand people would turn up at this point and54

chapter 10  there were just the very dim pinkish outlines of the doors
which glowed in the dark and pulsed whenever they spoke, though he had
tried every way he could think of of stopping them 
standing now, silent and alone in the dark corridor he remembered the mo-
ment and shivered  the way he was feeling he
didnt think he was an awfully good person to be in control 
in fact hed always more or less assumed that he had one as he had a full
complement of everything else, and indeed two of somethings, but suddenly
actually to encounter the thing lurking there deep within him had giving him
a severe jolt 
and then to discover (this was the second shock) that it wasnt the totally
wonderful object which he felt a man in his position had a natural right to
expect had jolted him again 
trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several enthusiastic things
on the subject of freedom 

55

i cant cope with it, he said darkly, and sent a third drink down to see why
the second hadnt yet reported on the condition of the first  he looked uncer-
tainly at both of her and preferred the one on the right 
youre drinking too much, said trillian 
look, she said in a sympathetic tone of voice, and sat down near him, its
quite understandable that youre going to feel a little aimless for a bit 
youve finished the mission youve been on for years 
i havent been on it  ive tried to avoid being on it 
youve still finished it  here i am, zaphod beeblebrox, i can go
anywhere, do anything 
are they?
as far as i can tell im not an expert in personal relationships  
trillian raised her eyebrows 
i am, he added, one hell of a guy, i can do anything i want only i just dont
have the faintest idea what 
one thing, he further added, has suddenly ceased to lead to another - in
contradiction of which he had another drink and slid gracelessly off his chair 
whilst he slept it off, trillian did a little research in the ships copy of the
hitch hikers guide to the galaxy  it had some advice to offer on drunken-
ness 
han wavel is a world which consists largely of fabulous ultra- luxury hotels
and casinos, all of which have been formed by the natural erosion of wind and
rain  little is
known of how this came about because none of the geophysicists, probability
statisticians, meteoranalysts or bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it
can afford to stay there 
terrific, thought trillian to herself, and within a few hours the great white
running-shoe ship was slowly powering down out of the sky beneath a hot bril-
liant sun towards a brightly coloured sandy spaceport  the ship was clearly
causing a sensation on the ground, and trillian was enjoying herself  she heard
zaphod moving around and whistling somewhere in the ship 
how are you? she said over the general intercom 
heigh ho, said eddie the computer 
trillian nodded patiently, tapped her fingers a couple of times and pushed the
intercom switch 
probably not, replied zaphod from wherever he was 
whatever you think, i think, said zaphod 
recreational impossibilities was a heading which caught trillians eye when,
a short while later, she sat down to flip through the guide again, and as the
heart of gold rushed at improbable speeds in an indeterminate direction, she
sipped a cup of something undrinkable from the nutrimatic drink dispenser
and read about how to fly 
the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy has this to say on the subject of flying  its no good de-
liberately intending to miss the ground because you wont  you have to have
your attention suddenly distracted by something else when youre halfway
there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground,
or about how much its going to hurt if you fail to miss it 
it is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these three things
during the split second you have at your disposal 
if, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily dis-
tracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseu-
dopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal inclination) or a bomb going
off in your vicinity, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle
crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the
ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what
might seem to be a slightly foolish manner 
ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher 
waft higher and higher 
trillian read this longingly, but reluctantly decided that zaphod wasnt re-
ally in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly, or for walking through
mountains or for trying to get the brantisvogan civil service to acknowledge
a change-of-address card, which were the other things listed under the heading
recreational impossibilities 
instead, she flew the ship to allosimanius syneca, a world of ice, snow, mind-
hurtling beauty and stunning cold  the trek from the snow plains of liska to
the summit of the ice crystal pyramids of sastantua is long and gruelling, even
with jet skis and a team of syneca snowhounds, but the view from the top,
a view which takes in the stin glacier fields, the shimmering prism moun-
tains and the far ethereal dancing icelights, is one which first freezes the mind
and then slowly releases it to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty, and
trillian, for one, felt that she could do with a bit of having her mind slowly
released to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty 
there lay the silverwhite beauty of allosimanius syneca beneath them 
zaphod stayed in bed with one head stuck under a pillow and the other doing
crosswords till late into the night 
trillian nodded patiently again, counted to a sufficiently high number, and
told herself that the important thing now was just to get zaphod talking 
she prepared, by dint of deactivating all the robot kitchen synthomatics, the
most fabulously delicious meal she could contrive - delicately oiled meals,
scented fruits, fragrant cheeses, fine aldebaran wines 
zark off, said zaphod 
trillian nodded patiently to herself, counted to an even higher number, tossed
the tray lightly aside, walked to the transport room and just teleported herself
the hell out of his life 
she didnt even programme any coordinates, she hadnt the faintest idea where
she was going, she just went - a random row of dots flowing through the uni-
verse 
good job too, muttered zaphod to himself, turned over and failed to go to
sleep 
the next day he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship, pretending

59

not to look for her, though he knew she wasnt there  he ignored the com-
puters querulous demands to know just what the hell was going on around
here by fitting a small electronic gag across a pair of its terminals 
it was a few hours later than this, as he stomped disconsolately about the
darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors, that he heard the wop said,
and it made him very nervous 
he leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man trying to
unbend a corkscrew by telekinesis 
who is it?
mmmmm mmm mmmmm, said the computer 
what?
mmmmm mmmm mm mmmmmmmm 
zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands  then he stared up the corridor to-
wards the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance from which more and
purposeful noises were coming, and in which the gagged terminals were situ-
ated 
mmmmm?
when i ungag you  
mmmmm 
mmmmm mmm?
either one 

mmmmm 
you didnt just go mmmm twice?
mmmm mmmm 
hmmmm 
he inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be yarding his way
down it, which was true  he
hadnt been able to turn off the doors courtesy voice circuits 
this doorway to the bridge was concealed from view within it because of the
excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been designed to curve round,
and he had been hoping to enter unobserved 
he leant despondently back against the wall again and said some words which
his other head was quite shocked to hear  he held his breath, and con-
gratulated himself on having lain in bed sulking for the last few days rather
than trying to work out his feelings on chest expanders in the ships gym 
he took a series of very shallow breaths, and then said as quickly and as qui-
etly as he could, door, if you can hear me, say so very, very quietly  now, in a moment, im going to ask you to open 
and i dont want you to say to me that i have made a simple door very
happy, or that it is your pleasure to open for me and your satisfaction to close
again with the knowledge of a job well done, ok?
ok  zaphod slipped quietly through 
is that the way you like it, mr beeblebrox? said the door out loud 
i want you to imagine, said zaphod to the group of white robots who swung
round to stare at him at that point, that i have an extremely powerful kill-
o-zap blaster pistol in my hand  there was something in-
tensely macabre about their appearance, especially to zaphod who had never
seen one before or even known anything about them  the krikkit wars be-
longed to the ancient past of the galaxy, and zaphod had spent most of his
early history lessons plotting how he was going to have sex with the girl in
the cybercubicle next to him, and since his teaching computer had been an
integral part of this plot it had eventually had all its history circuits wiped
and replaced with an entirely different set of ideas which had then resulted in
it being scrapped and sent to a home for degenerate cybermats, whither it
was followed by the girl who had inadvertently fallen deeply in love with the
unfortunate machine, with the result (a) that zaphod never got near her and
(b) that he missed out on a period of ancient history that would have been of
inestimable value to him at this moment  from their hideously
dead eyes to their powerful lifeless feet, they were clearly the calculated prod-
uct of a mind that wanted simply to kill  zaphod gulped in cold fear 
they had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall, and had forced a
passage through some of the vital innards of the ship  through the tangled
wreckage zaphod could see, with a further and worse sense of shock, that they
were tunnelling towards the very heart of the ship, the heart of the improba-
bility drive that had been so mysteriously created out of thin air, the heart
of gold itself  before going on
to what it actually said, it is worth recording at this point that zaphod was the
first living organic being to hear one of these creatures speak for something
over ten billion years 
it said, you do have a kill-o-zap blaster pistol in your hand 
zaphod didnt know what it meant for a moment, but then he glanced down
at his own hand and was relieved to see that what he had found clipped to a
wall bracket was indeed what he had thought it was 
yeah, he said in a kind of relieved sneer, which is quite tricky, well, i
wouldnt want to overtax your imagination, robot  for a while nobody said
anything, and zaphod realized that the robots were obviously not here to make
conversation, and that it was up to him 
again, they made no response to this, and zaphod wondered if the conversa-
tion would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of it in the form of
questions  havent you? he added 
er, ok, said zaphod 
zaphod nodded 
the gold bail is part of the key we seek, continued the robot, to release
our masters from krikkit 
zaphod nodded again 
the key, continued the robot simply, was disintegrated in time and space 
it will
be reconstituted in the key 
zaphod nodded again  we seek the key, it repeated, we already have the
wooden pillar, the steel pillar and the perspex pillar 
you will not, said zaphod 
zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him again before he fell down 



shhh, said slartibartfast 
night had now fallen on ancient krikkit  they stood beneath a tree from
which heady fragrances wafted around them 
the sky was, however, extremely blank and seemed to arthur to cast a cer-
tain chill over the otherwise idyllic, if currently invisible, landscape  still, he
supposed, its a question of what youre used to  slartibartfast was quietly direct-
ing his attention to something down the other side of the hill  arthur could almost imagine paul mccartney sitting with his feet up
by the fire on evening, humming it to linda and wondering what to buy with
the proceeds, and thinking probably essex 

the masters of krikkit, breathed slartibartfast in sepulchral tones  then the logic of the situation
imposed itself on his scattered mind, and he discovered that he still didnt
understand what the old man meant 
the masters of krikkit, said slartibartfast again, and if his breathing had
been sepulchral before, this time he sounded like someone in hades with bron-
chitis 
the people in the group were clearly alien, if only because they seemed a lit-
tle tall, thin, angular and almost as pale as to be white, but otherwise they
appeared remarkably pleasant; a little whimsical perhaps, one wouldnt neces-
sarily want to spend a long coach journey with them, but the point was that
if they deviated in any way from being good straightforward people it was in
being perhaps too nice rather than not nice enough  so why all this rasping
lungwork from slartibartfast which would seem more appropriate to a radio
commercial for one of those nasty films about chainsaw operators taking their
work home with them?
then, this krikkit angle was a tough one, too  he hadnt quite fathomed the
connection between what he knew as cricket, and what  
slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point as if sensing what
was going through his mind 
the game you know as cricket, he said, and his voice still seemed to be
wandering lost in subterranean passages, is just one of those curious freaks of
racial memory which can keep images alive in the mind aeons after their true
significance has been lost in the mists of time  of all the races on the galaxy,
only the english could possibly revive the memory of the most horrific wars
ever to sunder the universe and transform it into what im afraid is generally
regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game  particularly the bit
about the little red ball hitting the wicket, thats very nasty 
and these, said slartibartfast, slipping back into crypt guttural and indicat-
ing the group of krikkit men who had now walked past them, are the ones
who started it all, and it will start tonight  their natural instinct was to tread quietly and stealthily
in pursuit of their quarry, though, as they were simply walking through a
recorded informational illusion, they could as easily have been wearing eupho-
niums and woad for all the notice their quarry would have taken of them  it came lilting back to them through the soft night air, and
was a sweet romantic ballad which would have netted mccartney kent and
sussex and enabled him to put in a fair offer for hampshire 
you must surely know, said slartibartfast to ford, what it is that is about
to happen?
me? said ford 
did you not learn ancient galactic history when you were a child?
i was in the cybercubicle behind zaphod, said ford, it was very distracting 
which isnt to say that i didnt learn some pretty stunning things  the middle eight bridge, which would have had mccartney firmly
consolidated in winchester and gazing intently over the test valley to the rich
pickings of the new forest beyond, had some curious lyrics  the songwriter
was referring to meeting with a girl not under the moon or beneath the
stars but above the grass, which struck arthur a little prosaic  then he
looked up again at the bewildering black sky, and had the distinct feeling that
there was an important point here, if only he could grasp what it was 
no, said slartibartfast, with a slight quickening of his step, the people of
krikkit have never thought to themselves we are alone in the universe  at
night it is totally blank, during the day there is the sun, but you cant look
directly at that so they dont 
you see, the reason why they have never thought we are alone in the uni-
verse is that until tonight they dont know about the universe 
imagine, he said, never even thinking we are alone simply because it has
never occurred to you to think that theres any other way to be 
im afraid this is going to be a little unnerving, he added 

sightless sky above them 
the profoundness of the shock and horror they emanated a few moments later
when the burning wreckage of a spaceship came hurtling and screaming out
of the sky and crashed about half a mile from where they were standing was
something that you had to be there to experience 
some speak of the heart of gold in hushed tones, some of the starship bistro-
math 
many speak of the legendary and gigantic starship titanic, a majestic and
luxurious cruise-liner launched from the great shipbuilding asteroid complexes
of artifactovol some hundreds of years ago now, and with good reason 
it was sensationally beautiful, staggeringly huge, and more pleasantly equipped
than any ship in what now remains of history (see note below on the cam-
paign for real time) but it had the misfortune to be built in the very earliest
days of improbability physics, long before this difficult and cussed branch of
knowledge was fully, or at all, understood 
the designers and engineers decided, in their innocence, to build a prototype
improbability field into it, which was meant, supposedly, to ensure that it was
infinitely improbable that anything would ever go wrong with any part of the
ship 
they did not realize that because of the quasi-reciprocal and circular nature
of all improbability calculations, anything that was infinitely improbable was
actually very likely to happen almost immediately 
the starship titanic was a monstrously pretty sight as it lay beached like a
silver arcturan megavoidwhale amongst the laser- lit tracery of its construc-
tion gantries, a brilliant cloud of pins and needles of light against the deep
interstellar blackness; but when launched, it did not even manage to complete
its very first radio message - an sos - before undergoing a sudden and gratu-
itous total existence failure 
another spectacular media event of that time was the supernova which the
star ysllodins underwent a few hours later  ysllodins is the star around which

69

most of the galaxys major insurance underwriters live, or rather lived 
but whilst these spaceships, and other great ones which come to mind, such
as the galactic fleet battleships - the gss daring, the gss audacy and the
gss suicidal insanity - are all spoken of with awe, pride, enthusiasm, affection,
admiration, regret, jealousy, resentment, in fact most of the better known emo-
tions, the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was
krikkit one, the first spaceship ever built by the people of krikkit  it wasnt  it looked as if it had been knocked up in some-
bodys backyard, and this was in fact precisely where it had been knocked up  the period of time which had elapsed between the
moment that the people of krikkit had discovered that there was such a thing
as space and the launching of their first spaceship was almost exactly a year 
ford prefect was extremely grateful, as he strapped himself in, that this was
just another informational illusion, and that he was therefore completely safe 
in real life it wasnt a ship he would have set foot in for all the rice wine in
china 
this is going to fly? said arthur, giving gaunt looks, at the lashed-together
pipework and wiring which festooned the cramped interior of the ship 
slartibartfast assured him that it would, that they were perfectly safe and that
it was all going to be extremely instructive and not a little harrowing 
why not, said ford, go mad?
in front of them and, of course, totally unaware of their presence for the very
good reason that they werent actually there, were the three pilots  they had been on the hill path that night singing
wholesome heartwarming songs  they had spent weeks stripping every
tiniest last secret out of the wreckage of that burnt-up spaceship, all the while
singing lilting spaceship- stripping ditties  i dont believe it 
the trip passed uneventfully for a while, and slartibartfast fastwound them
through it 
very quickly, therefore, they arrived at the inner perimeter of the hollow, spher-
ical dust cloud which surrounded their sun and home planet, occupying, as
it were, the next orbit out  the darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple past them  it was a
very cold darkness, a very blank and heavy darkness, it was the darkness of
the night sky of krikkit 
the coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a slow grip on arthurs
heart, and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of the krikkit pilots which hung
in the air like a thick static charge 
their historic mission was to find out if there was anything or anywhere on
the other side of the sky, from which the wrecked spaceship could have come,
another world maybe, strange and incomprehensible though this thought was
to the enclosed minds of those who had lived beneath the sky of krikkit 
still the darkness thrummed at them, the blank enclosing darkness 
for a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep of the galaxy,
itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the universe 
itll have to go, the men of krikkit said as they headed back for home 
on the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective songs on the
subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life and the obliter-
ation of all other life forms 



so you see, said slartibartfast, slowly stirring his artificially constructed
coffee, and thereby also stirring the whirlpool interfaces between real and un-
real numbers, between the interactive perceptions of mind and universe, and
thus generating the restructured matrices of implicitly enfolded subjectivity
which allowed his ship to reshape the very concept of time and space, how it
is 
what do i do, said arthur, with this piece of chicken?
slartibartfast glanced at him gravely 
arthur did so, and felt the slight tingle of a mathematical function thrilling
through the chicken leg as it moved four- dimensionally through what slart-
ibartfast had assured him was five-dimensional space 
overnight, said slartibartfast, the whole population of krikkit was trans-
formed from being charming, delightful, intelligent   manic xenophobes  the idea of a universe didnt fit into their world
picture, so to speak  they simply couldnt cope with it  and so, charmingly,
delightfully, intelligently, whimsically if you like, they decided to destroy it 
whats the matter now?
i dont like the wine very much, said arthur sniffing it  he didnt like the topography of the waiters smile, but hed74

the people of krikkit, said his high judgmental supremacy, judiciary pag,
livr (the learned, impartial and very relaxed) chairman of the board of
judges at the krikkit war crimes trial, are, well, you know, theyre just a
bunch of real sweet guys, you know, who just happen to want to kill everybody 
ok, he continued, swinging his feet up on to the bench in front of him and
pausing a moment to pick a thread off his ceremonial beach loafers, so you
wouldnt necessarily want to share a galaxy with these guys 
the krikkit attack on the galaxy had been stunning  thousands and thou-
sands of huge krikkit warships had leapt suddenly out of hyperspace and
simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of major worlds, first seiz-
ing vital material supplies for building the next wave, and then calmly zapping
those worlds out of existence 
the galaxy, which had been enjoying a period of unusual peace and prosperity
at the time, reeled like a man getting mugged in a meadow 
this too was true, and is the only explanation anyone has yet managed to
come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the people of krikkit
had pursued their new and absolute purpose - the destruction of everything
that wasnt krikkit 
it is also the only explanation for their bewildering sudden grasp of all the
hypertechnology involved in building their thousands of spaceships, and their
millions of lethal white robots 
these had really struck terror into the hearts of everyone who had encoun-
tered them - in most cases, however, the terror was extremely short-lived,76

chapter 13  they wielded formidable multifunctional battleclubs
which, brandished one way, would knock down buildings and, brandished an-
other way, fired blistering omni-destructo zap rays and, brandished a third
way, launched a hideous arsenal of grenades, ranging from minor incendiary
devices to maxi-slorta hypernuclear devices which could take out a major
sun  simply striking the grenades with the battleclubs simultaneously primed
them, and launched them with phenomenal accuracy over distances ranging
from mere yards to hundreds of thousands of miles 
ok, said judiciary pag again, so we won  we won, he repeated, but thats no big deal 
it was clear that like most of the
galactic legal profession he found judiciary pag (or zipo bibrok 5 / 108, as
his private name was known, inexplicably, to be) a rather distressing figure 
he was clearly a bounder and a cad 
er, well, mlud, very approximately, two thousand years, the clerk mur-
mured unhappily 
and how many guys zilched out?
two grillion, mlud  a hydrospectic photo of him at
this point would have revealed that he was steaming slightly 
judiciary pag gazed once more around the courtroom, wherein were assembled
hundreds of the very highest officials of the entire galactic administration, all
in their ceremonial uniforms or bodies, depending on metabolism and custom  this was the most momentous occasion in legal history,
and judiciary pag knew it 
thats a whole lotta stiffs, he said quietly 
so, like i said, these are a bunch of really sweet guys, but you wouldnt want
to share a galaxy with them, not if theyre just gonna keep at it, not if theyre
not gonna learn to relax a little  i mean its just gonna be continual nervous
time, isnt it, right? pow, pow, pow, when are they next coming at us? peace-
ful coexistence is just right out, right? get me some water somebody, thank
you 
he sat back and sipped reflectively  sounds crazy, but i think
youll agree 
ive heard a lot worse, he said 
he scratched his crotch reflectively 
er, no, mlud, said the court usher who had brought it to him, rather ner-
vously 
the solution was brilliant, and went like this:
the planet of krikkit was to be enclosed for perpetuity in an envelope of
slo-time, inside which life would continue almost infinitely slowly  all light
would be deflected round the envelope so that it would remain invisible and
impenetrable 
when the rest of the universe came to its final end, when the whole of creation
reached its dying fall (this was all, of course, in the days before it was known
that the end of the universe would be a spectacular catering venture) and
life and matter ceased to exist, then the planet of krikkit and its sun would
emerge from its slo-time envelope and continue a solitary existence, such as
it craved, in the twilight of the universal void 
the key would be the symbol of the galaxy - the wikkit gate 
by the time the applause in the court had died down, judiciary pag was al-
ready in the sens-o-shower with a rather nice member of the jury that hed
slipped a note to half an hour earlier 



two months later, zipo bibrok 5 / 108 had cut the bottoms off his galactic
state jeans, and was spending part of the enormous fee his judgments com-
manded lying on a jewelled beach having essence of qualactin rubbed into his
back by the same rather nice member of the jury  she was a soolfinian girl
from beyond the cloudworlds of yaga 
weeeeelaaaaah! said zipo bibrok 5 / 108, and you would have had to have
been there to know exactly why he said this 
no, he added, when the thing that had made him say weeeeelaaaaah had
stopped happening  he moved his body round slightly to catch the first rays
of the third and greatest of primeval vods three suns which was now creeping
over the ludicrously beautiful horizon, and the sky now glittered with some of
the greatest tanning power ever known 
i hope it isnt good news, muttered zipo bibrok 5 / 108, cos i dont think
i could bear it 
your krikkit judgment was carried out today, said the girl sumptuously 
uhuh, muttered zipo and rested his head back on the jewelled sand 
mmmm?
just after the slo-time envelope was locked, she said, and paused a moment80

chapter 14 

from rubbing in the essence of qualactin, a krikkit warship which had been
missing presumed destroyed turned out to be just missing after all 
zipo sat up sharply  the key and the warship were
disintegrated and blasted into the space-time continuum 
she smiled, and ran a little more essence of qualactin on to her fingertips 



nothing is lost for ever, said slartibartfast, his face flickering redly in the
light of the candle which the robot waiter was trying to take away, except for
the cathedral of chalesm 
the cathedral of chalesm, repeated slartibartfast  the robot waiter moved through the space-time
matrices in a way which spectacularly combined the surly with the obsequious,
made a snatch for the candle and got it  they had had the bill, had argued
convincingly about who had had the cannelloni and how many bottles of wine
they had had, and, as arthur had been dimly aware, had thereby successfully
manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into a parking orbit round
a strange planet  the waiter was now anxious to complete his part of the
charade and clear the bistro 
all will become clear, said slartibartfast  theres a lot
of muck floating about in them, flotsam and jetsam, and more and more of
it is now being regurgitated into the physical world  because im eager to get there 
we are going, said slartibartfast in a slow, measured voice, to try to pre-
vent the war robots of krikkit from regaining the whole of the key they need
to unlock the planet of krikkit from the slo-time envelope and release the82

chapter 15 
he realized that it had been a mistake, because the idea seemed to exercise a
strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of ford prefect  the more that
slartibartfast unravelled the dark and tragic story of krikkit and its people,
the more ford prefect wanted to drink a lot and dance with girls 
the old man felt that he should not have mentioned the party until he ab-
solutely had to  but there it was, the fact was out, and ford prefect had
attached himself to it the way an arcturan megaleach attaches itself to its
victim before biting his head off and making off with his spaceship 
when, said ford eagerly, do we get there?
when ive finished telling you why we have to go there 
i know why im going, said ford, and leaned back, sticking his hands behind
his head 
slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement 
he had been planning to learn to play the octraventral heebiephone - a pleas-
antly futile task, he knew, because he had the wrong number of mouths 
listen, he said, at camtim   i noticed that
five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent times plopped back into
existence seemed to correspond to the five pieces of the missing key  we must go there to
retrieve it before the krikkit robots find it, or who knows what may hap?
no, said ford firmly 
but havent you understood everything i  ?
yes, said ford, with a sudden and unexpected fierceness, ive understood
it all perfectly well  thats why i want to have as many drinks and dance with
as many girls as possible while there are still any left  if everything youve

83

shown us is true   then we dont stand a whelks chance in a supernova 
a whelks chance in a supernova, repeated ford without losing momentum 
whats a whelk got to do with a supernova? said arthur  the freshly puzzled looks
clambering across arthurs face told him that it wasnt  its a star which
burns up other stars, got it? nothing stands a chance in a supernova 
so why a whelk particularly?
why not a whelk? doesnt matter 
arthur accepted this, and ford continued, picking up his early fierce momen-
tum as best he could 
the point is, he said, that people like you and me, slartibartfast, and
arthur - particularly and especially arthur - are just dilletantes, eccentrics,
layabouts, fartarounds if you like 
slartibartfast frowned, partly in puzzlement and partly in umbrage 
and thats the deciding factor  they care,
we dont 
would you die for them?
fjords? blinked slartibartfast in surprise 
wouldnt see the point, to be honest 
and i still cant see the connection, said arthur, with whelks 

84

chapter 15 

ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control, and refused to be
sidetracked by anything at this point 
the point is, he hissed, that we are not obsessive people, and we dont
stand a chance against  
except for your sudden obsession with whelks, pursued arthur, which i
still havent understood 
will you please leave whelks out of it?
i will if you will, said arthur 
he leant forward and rested his forehead on the tips of his fingers 
i think thats what i was trying to say, said ford 
for some unexplained reason, the teleport cubicles were in the bathroom 
the encyclopedia galactica has much to say on the theory and practice of
time travel, most of which is incomprehensible to anyone who hasnt spent at
least four lifetimes studying advanced hypermathematics, and since it was im-
possible to do this before time travel was invented, there is a certain amount of
confusion as to how the idea was arrived at in the first place  one rationaliza-
tion of this problem states that time travel was, by its very nature, discovered
simultaneously at all periods of history, but this is clearly bunk 
they are/were unspeakably wonderful  that is to say, you couldnt speak very
much of them at once without being so overcome with emotion, truth and a
sense of wholeness and oneness of things that you wouldnt pretty soon need
a brisk walk round the block, possibly pausing at a bar on the way back for a
quick glass of perspective and soda 
lallafa had lived in the forests of the long lands of effa  he wrote them on pages made of dried habra leaves,
without the benefit of education or correcting fluid 
then, shortly after the invention of time travel, some major correcting fluid
manufacturers wondered whether his poems might have been better still if he
had had access to some high-quality correcting fluid, and whether he might
be persuaded to say a few words on that effect  in fact they
persuaded him to such an effect that he became extremely rich at their hands,
and the girl about whom he was otherwise destined to write which such preci-
sion never got around to leaving him, and in fact they moved out of the forest
to a rather nice pad in town and he frequently commuted to the future to do
chat shows, on which he sparkled wittily  the manufacturers of correcting fluid simply packed
him off for a week somewhere with a copy of a later edition of his book and a
stack of dried habra leaves to copy them out on to, making the odd deliberate
mistake and correction on the way  others argue
that they are exactly the same as they always were, so whats changed? the
first people say that that isnt the point  they arent quite sure what the
point is, but they are quite sure that that isnt it  their case was con-
siderably strengthened by the fact that a week after they had set themselves
up, news broke that not only had the great cathedral of chalesm been pulled
down in order to build a new ion refinery, but that the construction of the
refinery had taken so long, and had had to extend so far back into the past in
order to allow ion production to start on time, that the cathedral of chalesm
had now never been built in the first place  the campaign for real timers claim
that just as easy travel eroded the differences between one country and an-
other, and between one world and another, so time travel is now eroding the
differences between one age and another 



arthur materialized, and did so with all the customary staggering about and
clasping at his throat, heart and various limbs which he still indulged himself
in whenever he made any of these hateful and painful materializations that he
was determined not to let himself get used to 
they werent there 
they still werent there 
they obstinately persisted in their absence 
he closed his eyes again, preparatory to making this completely futile exercise
once more, and because it was only then, whilst his eyes were closed, that his
brain began to register what his eyes had been looking at whilst they were
open, a puzzled frown crept across his face  obviously this wasnt a party  he coughed very slightly, and then had
to listen to the thin ghostly echo of his cough trailing away amongst winding
corridors and sightless chambers, as of some great labyrinth, and eventually
returning to him via the same unseen corridors, as if to say   yes?
this happened to every slightest noise he made, and it unnerved him  he tried
to hum a cheery tune, but by the time it returned to him it was a hollow dirge88

chapter 17 
his mind was suddenly full of images from the story that slartibartfast had
been telling him  they didnt  he didnt know what he did expect 
someone or something, however, seemed to be expecting him, for at that mo-
ment there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie green neon sign 
it was trying, arthur realized after staring at this perplexedly for a second
or two, to indicate that there was more to come, that the sentence was not
complete  or at least,
inhuman pedantry 
after a moment, it added:
i dont think 
the stone-cold fear which had been hovering about arthur all this time, wait-
ing for its moment, recognized that its moment had now come and pounced
on him  he peered huntedly into the darkness 
he cleared his throat and said it again, more loudly and without the er  at
some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly as if somebody started to

89

beat on a bass drum 
he listened to it for a few seconds and realized that it was just his heart beat-
ing 
he listened for a few seconds more and realized that it wasnt his heart beat-
ing, it was somebody down the corridor beating on a bass drum  he put
a hand out on the floor to steady his alert crouch, which wasnt holding up
very well  he wasnt certain if this was because they were
trying to see more clearly, or if they simply wanted to leave at this point 
this unnerved arthur dent even more than a reply would have done, and he
began to back away from the scary nothingness 
this really unnerved him, and he started to back away from that, back the
way he had come 
this, he couldnt help thinking, must be a foolish thing to do 
it turned out at this point that his second impulse had been the correct one,
because there was an indescribably hideous monster standing quietly behind
him  arthur yawed wildly as his skin tried to jump one way and his skeleton
the other, whilst his brain tried to work out which of his ears it most wanted
to crawl out of 
bet you werent expecting to see me again, said the monster, which arthur

90

chapter 17 

couldnt help thinking was a strange remark for it to make, seeing as he had
never met the creature before  he could tell that he hadnt met the creature
before from the simple fact that he was able to sleep at nights 
a terrible cold calm came over him as he realized that what he was looking at
was a six-foot-high hologram of a housefly 
he wondered why anybody would be showing him a six-foot-high hologram of
a housefly at this time 
it was a terribly realistic hologram 
or perhaps you remember me better, said the voice suddenly, and it was a
deep, hollow malevolent voice which sounded like molten tar glurping out of a
drum with evil on its mind, as the rabbit  arthur was startled to see his own
reflection in its soft and lovable unblinking and extremely huge brown eyes  i happen to
know that because in my next life i came back as a fly again and you swatted
me  only this time you swatted me with the bag youd made of my
previous skin 
arthur dent, you are not merely a cruel and heartless man, you are also
staggeringly tactless 
the voice paused whilst arthur gawped  he wanted to explain that he had been in
fact very fond of the bag and had looked after it very well and had taken it with
him wherever he went, but that somehow every time he travelled anywhere he
seemed inexplicably to end up with the wrong bag and that, curiously enough,
even as they stood there he was just noticing for the first time that the bag
he had with him at the moment appeared to be made out of rather nasty fake
leopard skin, and wasnt the one hed had a few moments ago before he arrived
in this whatever place it was, and wasnt one he would have chosen himself

91

and heaven knew what would be in it as it wasnt his, and he would much
rather have his original bag back, except that he was of course terribly sorry
for having so peremptorily removed it, or rather its component parts, i  the
rabbit skin, from its previous owner, viz 
all he actually managed to say was erp 
meet the newt you trod on, said the voice 
and there was, standing in the corridor with arthur, a giant green scaly newt 
that was me, too, continued the voice in a low menacing rumble, as if you
didnt know   any world, any body, any time, im just getting settled down,
along comes arthur dent - pow, he kills me  bit of a memory jogger  bit of a bloody
giveaway!
thats funny, my spirit would say to itself as it winged its way back to the
netherworld after another fruitless dent-ended venture into the land of the
living, that man who just ran over me as i was hopping across the road to
my favourite pond looked a little familiar  
heres the moment, dent, shrieked the voice, now reaching a feverish pitch
of hatred, heres the moment when at last i knew!
it was indescribably hideous, the thing that suddenly opened up in front of
arthur, making him gasp and gargle with horror, but heres an attempt at a
description of how hideous it was  it was a huge palpitating wet cave with a
vast, slimy, rough, whale-like creature rolling around it and sliding over mon-
strous white tombstones  high above the cave rose a vast promontory in which
could be seen the dark recesses of two further fearful caves, which  
yes! hissed agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather deft syllogism 
well, im afraid it was still a coincidence, said arthur 
come in here and say that! howled the voice, in sudden apoplexy again  it was horrific 
the vast, incomprehensibly vast chamber looked as if it had been carved out
of the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this was that that was precisely
what it had been carved out of  it seemed to arthur to spin sickeningly round
his head as he stood and gaped at it 
where it wasnt black you were inclined to wish that it was, because the colours
with which some of the unspeakable details were picked out ranged horribly
across the whole spectrum of eye-defying colours from ultra violent to infra

93

dead, taking in liver purple, loathsome lilac, matter yellow, burnt hombre
and gan green on the way 
the unspeakable details which these colours picked out were gargoyles which
would have put francis bacon off his lunch 
the gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls, from the pillars, from the
flying buttresses, from the choir stalls, towards the statue, to which we will
come in a moment 
and if the gargoyles would have put francis bacon off his lunch, then it was
clear from the gargoyles faces that the statue would have put them off theirs,
had they been alive to eat it, which they werent, and had anybody tried to
serve them some, which they wouldnt  so, for instance, the name of a cow which had been slaugh-
tered and of which arthur dent had happened to eat a fillet steak would have
the plainest engraving, whereas the name of a fish which arthur had himself
caught and then decided he didnt like and left on the side of the plate had
a double underlining, three sets of asterisks and a bleeding dagger added as
decoration, just to make the point  it was an annoyance of epic
proportions, a burning searing flame of annoyance, an annoyance which now
spanned the whole of time and space in its infinite umbrage  fifty feet tall if it was an inch, there was not an inch of
it which wasnt crammed with insult to its subject matter, and fifty feet of
that sort of thing would be enough to make any subject feel bad  from the
small pimple on the side of his nose to the poorish cut of his dressing gown,
there was no aspect of arthur dent which wasnt lambasted and vilified by
the sculptor 
arthur appeared as a gorgon, an evil, rapacious, ravenning, bloodied ogre,
slaughtering his way through an innocent one-man universe 
with each of the thirty arms which the sculptor in a fit of artistic fervour had

94

chapter 17 

decided to give him, he was either braining a rabbit, swatting a fly, pulling a
wishbone, picking a flea out of his hair, or doing something which arthur at
first looking couldnt quite identify 
arthur put his hands over his eyes, hung his head and shook it slowly from
side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness of things 
and when he opened his eyes again, there in front of him stood the figure of
the man or creature, or whatever it was, that he had supposedly been perse-
cuting all this time 
hhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaahhhhhh! said agrajag  he waddled slowly around
arthur, and poked at him with bent claws 
agrajag was black, bloated, wrinkled and leathery 
his batwings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic broken
floundering things they were that if they had been strong, muscular beaters
of the air 
they looked as if they each came from a completely different animal, and they
were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre angles it seemed that if he ever
actually tried to chew anything hed lacerate half his own face along with it,
and possibly put an eye out as well 
this seemed on the face of it such a preposterous notion that arthur practi-
cally choked 
i was at, roared agrajag, a cricket match! i had a weak heart condition,
but what, i said to my wife, can happen to me at a cricket match? as im
watching, what happens?
two people quite maliciously appear out of thin air just in front of me 
coincidence? screamed the creature, painfully thrashing its broken wings,
and opening a short gash on its right cheek with a particularly nasty tooth 
on closer examination, such as hed been hoping to avoid, arthur noticed that
much of agrajags face was covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters 
what have you got against me, dent? snarled the creature, advancing on
him in a painful waddle 
agrajag fixed him with a beady stare 
seems a strange way to relate to somebody youve got nothing against, killing
them all the time 
id also call it a lie!
but look, said arthur, im very sorry  theres been a terrible misunder-
standing  ive got to go  have you got a clock? im meant to be helping save
the universe 
agrajag advanced still further  i would stay in the netherworld  and what happened?
arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that he had no idea and
didnt want to have one either  he glanced up at his own horren-
dously parodied image towering above him 
i got yanked involuntarily back into the physical world, pursued agrajag,
as a bunch of petunias  and youd be right  in, i might add,
the fresh wreckage of a whale 
on the way down, he snarled, i couldnt help noticing a flashy-looking

96

chapter 17  he glanced up again, and realized that the arm that
had puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into existence a bowl of
doomed petunias  i have to find a silver bail, thats the point 
save the universe! spat agrajag with contempt  you should have thought
of that before you started your vendetta against me! what about the time
you were on stavromula beta and someone  
ive never been there, said arthur  tried to assassinate you and you ducked 
agrajag stopped in his tracks  you were responsible for my death there, as ev-
erywhere else 
ive never heard of the place, insisted arthur  ive certainly never had any-
one try to assassinate me  perhaps i go there later, do you
think?
agrajag blinked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror 
you havent been to stavromula beta  
no, said arthur, i dont know anything about the place  certainly never
been to it, and dont have any plans to go 
oh, you go there all right, muttered agrajag in a broken voice, you go
there all right  ive brought you here too soon!
he started to scream and bellow  ive brought you here too zarking soon!
suddenly he rallied, and turned a baleful, hating eye on arthur 
im going to kill you anyway! he roared  even if its a logical impossibility
im going to zarking well try! im going to blow this whole mountain up! he
screamed, lets see you get out of this one, dent!
he rushed in a painful waddling hobble to what appeared to be a small black
sacrificial altar 
agrajag screamed again, thrashed wildly for a brief moment, and turned a
wild eye on arthur 
you know what youve done? he gurgled painfully  youve only gone and
killed me again  i mean, what do you want from me, blood?
he thrashed again in a brief apoplectic fit, quivered, and collapsed, smacking
a large red button on the altar as he did so 
arthur started with horror and fear, first at what he appeared to have done,
and then at the loud sirens and bells that suddenly shattered the air to an-
nounce some clamouring emergency  he pelted towards it, throw-
ing away the nasty fake leopard-skin bag as he did so 
he dashed randomly, haphazardly through the labyrinthine maze, he seemed
to be pursued more and more fiercely by claxons, sirens, flashing lights 
it wasnt flashing 



although it has been said that on earth alone in our galaxy is krikkit (or
cricket) treated as fit subject for a game, and that for this reason the earth
has been shunned, this does only apply to our galaxy, and more specifically
to our dimension  in some of the higher dimensions they feel they can more
or less please themselves, and have been playing a peculiar game called brock-
ian ultra-cricket for whatever their transdimensional equivalent of billions of
years is 
lets be blunt, its a nasty game (says the hitch hikers guide to the
galaxy) but then anyone who has been to any of the higher dimensions will
know that theyre a pretty nasty heathen lot up there who should just be
smashed and done in, and would be, too, if anyone could work out a way of
firing missiles at right-angles to reality 
this is another example of the fact that the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy
will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in off the street and get ripped
off, especially if they happen to walk in off the street during the afternoon,
when very few of the regular staff are there 
the history of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy is one of idealism, strug-
gle, despair, passion, success, failure, and enormously long lunch-breaks 
most of the surviving stories, however, speak of a founding editor called hurl-
ing frootmig 
there followed many years of penury and heart-searching during which he con-
sulted friends, sat in darkened rooms in illegal states of mind, thought about100

chapter 18 

this and that, fooled about with weights, and then, after a chance encounter
with the holy lunching friars of voondon (who claimed that just as lunch
was at the centre of a mans temporal day, and mans temporal day could be
seen as an analogy for his spiritual life, so lunch should
(a) be seen as the centre of a mans spiritual life, and
(b) be held in jolly nice restaurants), he refounded the guide, laid down its
fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and where you could stuff them
both, and led the guide on to its first major commercial success 
shortly after this, the guide was taken over by megadodo publications of ursa
minor beta, thus putting the whole thing on a very sound financial footing,
and allowing the fourth editor, lig lury jr, to embark on lunch-breaks of such
breathtaking scope that even the efforts of recent editors, who have started
undertaking sponsored lunch-breaks for charity, seem like mere sandwiches in
comparison 
in fact, lig never formally resigned his editorship - he merely left his office
late one morning and has never since returned 
strictly speaking, all editors since lig lury jr have therefore been designated
acting editors, and ligs desk is still preserved the way he left it, with the
addition of a small sign which says lig lury jr, editor, missing, presumed
fed 
some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that lig actually
perished in the guides first extraordinary experiments in alternative book-
keeping 
it is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that the two or three days
prior to the demolition of the planet earth to make way for a new hyperspace
bypass saw a dramatic upsurge in the number of ufo sightings there, not
only above lords cricket ground in st  johns wood, london, but also above
glastonbury in somerset 

101

glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings, witchcraft,
ley-lines an wart curing, and had now been selected as the site for the new
hitch hikers guide financial records office, and indeed, ten years worth of
financial records were transferred to a magic hill just outside the city mere
hours before the vogons arrived 
none of these facts, however strange or inexplicable, is as strange or inexplica-
ble as the rules of the game of brockian ultra-cricket, as played in the higher
dimensions  a full set of rules is so massively complicated that the only time
they were all bound together in a single volume, they underwent gravitational
collapse and became a black hole 
rule two: find one good brockian ultra-cricket player  clone him off a few
times 
the reason for this is that, though the game is a major spectator sport, the
frustration experienced by the audience at not actually being able to see whats
going on leads them to imagine that its a lot more exciting than it really is  a
crowd that has just watched a rather humdrum game experiences far less life-
affirmation than a crowd that believes it has just missed the most dramatic
event in sporting history  anything will do - cricket bats, basecube bats, tennis guns,
skis, anything you can get a good swing with 
apologies should be concise, sincere and, for maximum clarity and points, de-
livered through a megaphone 
curiously enough, the more the obsession with the game grows in the higher
dimensions, the less it is actually played, since most of the competing teams
are now in a state of permanent warfare with each other over the interpreta-
tion of these rules  this is all for the best, because in the long run a good
solid war is less psychologically damaging than a protracted game of brockian
ultra-cricket  the avalance began 
stones, then rocks, then boulders which pranced past him like clumsy puppies,
only much, much bigger, much, much harder and heavier, and almost infinitely
more likely to kill you if they fell on you  that he was clearly bound to survive if the next
foreshadowed incident in the saga of his inadvertent persecution of agrajag
was to happen, was utterly failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise
any restraining influence on him at this time  but just at the moment that he was about to hit the ground as-
toundingly hard he saw lying directly in front of him a small navy-blue holdall
that he knew for a fact he had lost in the baggage-retrieval system at athens
airport some ten years in his personal time-scale previously, and in his aston-
ishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed off into the air with his
brain singing  blinking with the non- effort of it he
wafted higher into the air, and now the boulders were hurtling through the air
beneath him 
he looked downwards with intense curiosity  between him and the shivering
ground were now some thirty feet of empty air, empty that is if you discounted
the boulders which didnt stay in it for long, but bounded downwards in the
iron grip of the law of gravity; the same law which seemed, all of a sudden, to
have given arthur a sabbatical 
it occurred to him almost instantly, with the instinctive correctness that self-
preservation instils in the mind, that he mustnt try to think about it, that
if he did, the law of gravity would suddenly glance sharply in his direction
and demand to know what the hell he thought he was doing up there, and all
would suddenly be lost  he thought about the
pleasing firm roundness of the bottom of tulips, he thought about the inter-
esting variety of colours they came in, and wondered what proportion of the
total number of tulips that grew, or had grown, on the earth would be found
within a radius of one mile from a windmill  he didnt look at it hard, but did his best just to give it an idle
glance, as it were, in passing  there were a couple of things he couldnt help
noticing  one was that the eruption of the mountain seemed now to have spent
itself - there was a crater just a little way beneath the peak, presumably where
the rock had caved in on top of the huge cavernous cathedral, the statue of
himself, and the sadly abused figure of agrajag  it was sit-
ting pertly on a piece of clear ground, surrounded by exhausted boulders but

105

apparently hit by none of them  why this should be he could not speculate,
but since this mystery was completely overshadowed by the monstrous impos-
sibility of the bags being there in the first place, it was not a speculation he
really felt strong enough for anyway 
here he was, flying along two hundred yards above the surface of an alien
planet the name of which he couldnt even remember 
if he picked the bag up, could he carry it? mightnt the extra weight just pull
him straight to the ground?
mightnt the mere act of touching something on the ground suddenly discharge
whatever mysterious force it was that was holding him in the air?
mightnt he be better off just being sensible at this point and stepping out of
the air, back on to the ground for a moment or two?
if he did, would he ever be able to fly again?
the sensation, when he allowed himself to be aware of it, was so quietly ec-
static that he could not bear the thought of losing it, perhaps for ever  with his arms spread out in front of him, his hair and
dressing gown streaming out behind him, he dived down out of the sky, bellied
along a body of air about two feet from the ground and swung back up again,
catching himself at the top of the swing and holding 
the air on his face, the bounce and woof of his body, all combined to make
him feel an intoxication of the spirit that he hadnt felt since, since - well as
far as he could work out, since he was born  it had
a wasted ravaged look  he didnt know what he was going to do after
he had picked up the bag  he didnt realize, but his body was willoming at this
point 
halfway down there was a sudden dangerous moment when he could no longer
believe he was doing this, and therefore he very nearly wasnt, but he recovered
himself in time, skimmed over the ground, slipped an arm smoothly through
the handles of the bag, and began to climb back up, couldnt make it and all
of a sudden collapsed, bruised, scratched and shaking in the stony ground  his body seemed like an unwieldy sack of potatoes that reeled stumbling
against the ground, his mind had all the lightness of a bag of lead  at
that moment he remembered that in the bag he was now carrying was not
only a can of greek olive oil but a duty-free allowance of retsina, and in the
pleasurable shock of that realization he failed to notice for at least ten seconds
that he was now flying again 
he whooped and cried with relief and pleasure, and sheer physical delight  cheekily he sat
on an updraught and went through the contents of the hold-all  he felt the
way he imagined an angel must feel during its celebrated dance on the head
of a pin whilst being counted by philosophers  he laughed with pleasure at

107

the discovery that the bag did in fact contain the olive oil and the retsina as
well as a pair of cracked sunglasses, some sand-filled swimming trunks, some
creased postcards of santorini, a large and unsightly towel, some interesting
stones, and various scraps of paper with the addresses of people he was relieved
to think he would never meet again, even if the reason why was a sad one 
the mess is extraordinary, and has to be seen to be believed, but if you dont
have any particular need to believe it, then dont go and look, because you
wont enjoy it 
there have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds, and there
is one theory that this is a battle being fought between the fleets of several
rival carpet-cleaning companies who are hovering over the thing like vultures,
but you shouldnt believe anything you hear at parties, and particularly not
anything you hear at this one 
one of the problems, and its one which is obviously going to get worse, is
that all the people at the party are either the children or the grandchildren
or the great-grandchildren of the people who wouldnt leave in the first place,
and because of all the business about selective breeding and regressive genes
and so on, it means that all the people now at the party are either absolutely
fanatical partygoers, or gibbering idiots, or, more and more frequently, both 
either way, it means that, genetically speaking, each succeeding generation is
now less likely to leave than the preceding one 
one night, long ago, a band of drunken astro-engineers of the first generation
clambered round the building digging this, fixing that, banging very hard on110

chapter 20 
the party had attacked and raided an awful lot of it, and no one has ever
succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and unpredictable way in
which it lurches round the sky 



arthur lay floundering in pain on a piece of ripped and dismembered reinforced
concrete, flicked at by wisps of passing cloud and confused by the sounds of
flabby merrymaking somewhere indistinctly behind him 
there was a sound he couldnt immediately identify, partly because he didnt
know the tune i left my leg in jaglan beta and partly because the band
playing it were very tired, and some members of it were playing it in three-four
time, some in four- four, and some in a kind of pie-eyed r2, each according to
the amount of sleep hed managed to grab recently  his back, too, was hurting,
but he soon satisfied himself that he was not badly hurt, but just bruised and
a little shaken, as who wouldnt be? he couldnt understand what a building
would be doing flying through the clouds  a wall of pale but stained stone slabs rose up behind him,
the building proper  he seemed to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or
lip which extended outwards for about three or four feet all the way around 
nervously, he stood up and, suddenly, looking out over the edge, he felt nau-
seous with vertigo 112

chapter 21 
he was edging in the direction of the nearest corner, in the hope that the wall
around the corner might offer more in the way of entrances than this one,
which offered none 
the unsteadiness of the buildings flight made him feel sick with fear, and after
a short while he took the towel from out of his hold-all and did something with
it which once again justified its supreme position in the list of useful things to
take with you when you hitch-hike round the galaxy  he put it over his head
so he wouldnt have to see what he was doing  his outstretched hand edged along the wall 
finally he came to the corner, and as his hand rounded the corner it encoun-
tered something which gave him such a shock that he nearly fell straight off 
he desperately wanted to use his other hand to pull the towel back from his
eyes, but it was holding the hold-all with the olive oil, the retsina and the
postcards from santorini, and he very much didnt want to put it down 
he experienced one of those self moments, one of those moments when you
suddenly turn around and look at yourself and think who am i? what am i
up to? what have i achieved? am i doing well? he whimpered very slightly 
he tried to free his hand, but he couldnt  this seemed
to provoke a sharp cry of some unfashionable emotion from the owner of the
other hand 
the towel was whipped from his head and he found his eyes peering into those
of ford prefect  beyond him stood slartibartfast, and beyond them he could
clearly see a porchway and a large closed door 
they were both pressed back against the wall, eyes wild with terror as they
stared out into the thick blind cloud around them, and tried to resist the lurch-
ing and swaying of the building 
where the zarking photon have you been? hissed ford, panic stricken 
er, well, stuttered arthur, not really knowing how to sum it all up that
briefly 

113

the first thing arthur noticed as they entered into the thick of the party, apart
from the noise, the suffocating heat, the wild profusion of colours that protuded
dimly through the atmosphere of heavy smoke, the carpets thick with ground
glass, ash and avocado droppings, and the small group of pterodactyl-like crea-
tures in lurex who descended on his cherished bottle of retsina, squawking, a
new pleasure, a new pleasure, was trillian being chatted up by a thunder
god 
didnt i see you at milliways? he was saying  so much less reputable, so much more fraught 
seems fun, said trillian 
then why dont you go and get one?
see you later, arthur, said trillian 
something jogged arthurs mind, and he looked around huntedly 
zaphod isnt here, is he? he said 
see you, said trillian firmly, later 
thor glared at him with hard coal-black eyes, his beard bristled, what little
light was there was in the place mustered its forces briefly to glint menacingly
off the horns of his helmet 
he took trillians elbow in his extremely large hand and the muscles in his
upper arm moved around each other like a couple of volkswagens parking 
one of the interesting things about space, arthur heard slartibartfast say-
ing to a large and voluminous creature who looked like someone losing a fight
with a pink duvet and was gazing raptly at the old mans deep eyes and silver
beard, is how dull it is  you see,
theres so much of it and so little in it  they, too, are quite sensationally dull 
ill come back and hear them in a moment, she said, patting him on the arm,
lifted up her skirts like a hovercraft and moved off into the heaving crown  come, earthman   ive had a tough day  trillians
here, incidentally, she didnt say how, it probably doesnt matter  all right, he added, in response to slartibartfasts increasing
agitation, ill wander round and see if anybodys seen it 
no, said the enthusiastically wizened little man, but do have a drink and
tell me all about it 
ford prefect writhed past, dancing a wild, frenetic and not entirely unobscene
dance with someone who looked as if she was wearing sydney opera house on
her head 
im not wearing a hat 
i said, you dance great, he shouted, just dont nod so much  ow! he added as his part-
ner nodded forward to say what? and once again pecked him sharply on
the forehead with the sharp end of her swept-forward skull 
my planet was blown up one morning, said arthur, who had found himself

115

quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story or, at least, edited high-
lights of it, thats why im dressed like this, in my dressing gown  i didnt realize id be coming
to a party 
ah, effervesced the little man, and did you have a wonderful time?
arthur started to choke violently on his drink 
together they performed a lung-busting duet which went on for fully two min-
utes before arthur managed to cough and splutter to a halt  he was wear-
ing black trousers, a black silk shirt open to what was presumably his navel,
though arthur had learnt never to make assumptions about the anatomies of
the sort of people he tended to meet these days, and had all sorts of nasty
dangly gold things hanging round his neck  he carried something in a black
bag, and clearly wanted people to notice that he didnt want them to notice
it  im just telling you, right? good night, good luck,
win awards  just
zark off!!!
ok, im going, said arthur hurriedly 
why did he tell me to win awards?
just showbiz talk, shrugged the girl  hes just won an award at the an-
nual ursa minor alpha recreational illusions institute awards ceremony, and
was hoping to be able to pass it off lightly, only you didnt mention it, so he
couldnt 
oh, said arthur, oh, well im sorry i didnt  its
very prestigious 
i see, said arthur, yes, and what do you get for that?
a rory  what did you
say?
i didnt say anything 
people had been dropping in on the party now for some years, fashionable
gatecrashers from other worlds, and for some time it had occurred to the
partygoers as they had looked out at their own world beneath them, with
its wrecked cities, its ravaged avocado farms and blighted vineyards, its vast
tracts of new desert, its seas full of biscuit crumbs and worse, that their world

117

was in some tiny and almost imperceptible ways not quite as much fun as it
had been  some of them had begun to wonder if they could manage to stay
sober for long enough to make the entire party spaceworthy and maybe take
it off to some other peoples worlds where the air might be fresher and give
them fewer headaches 
the few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out a feeble
existence on the half-dead ground of the planets surface would have been
extremely pleased to hear this, but that day, as the party came screaming
out of the clouds and the farmers looked up in haggard fear of yet another
cheese-and-wine raid, it became clear that the party was not going to be going
anywhere else for a while, that the party would soon be over  very soon it
would be time to gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to find
out what time of day it was, what time of year it was, and whether in any of
this burnt and ravaged land there was a taxi going anywhere 
the party and the krikkit warship looked, in their writhings, a little like two
ducks, one of which is trying to make a third duck inside the second duck,
whilst the second duck is trying very hard to explain that it doesnt feel ready
for a third duck right now, is uncertain that it would want any putative third
duck to be made by this particular first duck anyway, and certainly not whilst
it, the second duck, was busy flying 
and suddenly, with a foop, the krikkit ship was gone 
for a while these staggerings continued, but clearly they could not continue
for long  they were going monstrously badly,
in fact, and people were hating it and saying so loudly  the krikkit robots
had been 
they had removed the award for the most gratuitous use of the word

118

chapter 21 

fuck in a serious screenplay, and in its place had left a scene of devastation
that left arthur feeling almost as sick as a runner-up for a rory 
the party lurched again, provoking feverish cries and groans from amongst the
smoking wreckage 
he took a packet of potato crisps too 
earthman, we must go, said slartibartfast nervously 
a moment or two later, trillian staggered, shaking, into view, supported by
her new friend the thunder god  theres a great party going on in val-
halla, well be flying off   flyings a tricky business you see,
you have to calculate wind  
hey, said trillian, dont i  
thor looked at him with slowly smouldering eyes 
come on, earthman, said slartibartfast nervously, picking at arthurs sleeve  slart-
ibartfast had the teleport device 
i beg your minuscule pardon? roared thor  then a little wisp of smoke curled up-

119

wards from his nostril 
he expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the sort of man
you only dared to cross if you had a team of sherpas with you 
he unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt 
do i want, he said, with a hiss like a river flowing through a steel mill, to
make something of it?
yes, said arthur, his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong and belliger-
ent 
good, said arthur, thats got rid of him 



all right, shouted ford at arthur, so im a coward, the point is im still
alive  they were back aboard the starship bistromath, so was slartibartfast,
so was trillian 
well, so am i alive, arent i? retaliated arthur, haggard with adventure and
anger 
arthur turned sharply to slartibartfast, who was sitting in his pilot couch
on the flight deck gazing thoughtfully into the bottom of a bottle which was
telling him something he clearly couldnt fathom 
do you think he understands the first word ive been saying? he said, quiv-
ering with emotion 
i dont know, replied slartibartfast, a little abstractedly  im not sure, he
added, glancing up very briefly, that i do  he stared at his instruments with
renewed vigor and bafflement  youll have to explain it to us again, he said 
we fared rather pathetically at the party, im afraid, he said, and our only
hope now is to try to prevent the robots from using the key in the lock  how
in heaven we do that i dont know, he muttered 
where is trillian anyway? said arthur with a sudden affectation of un-
concern  arthurs own opinion, and he had
offered it for whatever anybody might have felt it was worth, was that he had
been extraordinarily brave and resourceful 

the prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth a pair of fetid
dingos kidneys  what really hurt, though, was that trillian didnt seem to
react much one way or the other and had wandered off somewhere  i think the potato crisps are probably
helping her 
for instance, there was once an insanely aggressive race of people called the
silastic armorfiends of striterax  the
name of their army was something quite horrific 
and fighting was what the silastic armorfiends of striterax were good at, and
being good at it, they did a lot  the surface
was littered with abandoned cities which were surrounded by abandoned war
machines, which were in turn surrounded by deep bunkers in which the silastic
armorfiends lived and squabbled with each other 
the best way to pick a fight with a silastic armorfiend was just to be born 
they didnt like it, they got resentful  and when an armorfiend got resentful,
someone got hurt 
the best way of dealing with a silastic armorfiend was to put him into a room
of his own, because sooner or later he would simply beat himself up 
eventually they realized that this was something they were going to have to
sort out, and they passed a law decreeing that anyone who had to carry a
weapon as part of his normal silastic work (policemen, security guards, pri-
mary school teachers, etc 

another achievement of the silastic armorfiends of striterax is that they were
the first race who ever managed to shock a computer 
it was a gigantic spaceborne computer called hactar, which to this day is re-
membered as one of the most powerful ever built  it was the first to be built
like a natural brain, in that every cellular particle of it carried the pattern of
the whole within it, which enabled it to think more flexibly and imaginatively,
and also, it seemed, to be shocked 
the silastic armorfiends of striterax were engaged in one of their regular
wars with the strenuous garfighters of stug, and were not enjoying it as much
as usual because it involved an awful lot of trekking through the radiation
swamps of cwulzenda, and across the fire mountains of frazfraga, neither of
which terrains they felt at home in 
so when the strangulous stilettans of jajazikstak joined in the fray and forced
them to fight another front in the gamma caves of carfrax and the ice storms
of varlengooten, they decided that enough was enough, and they ordered hac-
tar to design for them an ultimate weapon 
what do you mean, asked hactar, by ultimate?
to which the silastic armorfiends of striterax said, read a bloody dictio-
nary, and plunged back into the fray 
so hactar designed an ultimate weapon 
it was a very, very small bomb which was simply a junction box in hyperspace
that would, when activated, connect the heart of every major sun with the
heart of every other major sun simultaneously and thus turn the entire uni-
verse in to one gigantic hyperspatial supernova 
when the silastic armorfiends tried to use it to blow up a strangulous stilet-
tan munitions dump in one of the gamma caves, they were extremely irritated
that it didnt work, and said so 
hactar had been shocked by the whole idea 
the silastic armorfiends disagreed and pulverized the computer 
then, pausing only to smash the hell out of the strenuous garfighters of stug,
and the strangulous stilettans of jajazikstak, they went on to find an entirely
new way of blowing themselves up, which was a profound relief to everyone else
in the galaxy, particularly the garfighters, the stilettans and the potatoes 

trillian had watched all this, as well as the story of krikkit 



even as the starship bistromath flickered into objective being on the top of a
small cliff on the mile-wide asteroid which pursued a lonely and eternal path
in orbit around the enclosed star system of krikkit, its crew was aware that
they were in time only to be witnesses to an unstoppable historic event 
they didnt realize they were going to see two 
an extension of the ships field enabled them to stand there, by once again
exploiting the minds predisposition to have tricks played on it: the problems
of falling up off the tiny mass of the asteroid, or of not being able to breathe,
simply became somebody elses 
the white krikkit warship was parked amongst the stark grey crags of the
asteroid, alternately flaring under arclights or disappearing in shadow  the
blackness of the shaped shadows cast by the hard rocks danced together in
wild choreography as the arclights swept round them 
the eleven white robots were bearing, in procession, the wikkit key out into
the middle of a circle of swinging lights 
the wikkit key was rebuilt  its components shone and glittered: the steel
pillar (or marvins leg) of strength and power, the gold bail (or heart of the
improbability drive) of prosperity, the perspex pillar (or argabuthon sceptre
of justice) of science and reason, the silver bail (or rory award for the most
gratuitous use of the word fuck in a serious screenplay) and the now
reconstituted wooden pillar (or ashes of a burnt stump signifying the death
of english cricket) of nature and spirituality 
no, sighed slartibartfast 

the expression of disappointment which crossed arthurs face was a complete
failure, and, since he was standing obscured by shadow, he allowed it to col-
lapse into one of relief 
trillian said nothing, but in a peculiarly thoughtful and distinct way  she was
staring at the blankness of the space beyond the asteroid 
the asteroid circled the dust cloud which surrounded the slo-time envelope
which enclosed the world on which lived the people of krikkit, the masters of
krikkit and their killer robots 
the helpless group had no way of knowing whether or not the krikkit robots
were aware of their presence 
terrible impotent feeling, isnt it? said arthur, but the others ignored him  it was moving slowly in towards the dust cloud, as
if being hauled in inexorably by some celestial angler in its depths  trillian frowned 
the dust dimmed the shafts of brilliant light  the shafts of brilliant light
twinkled on the myriad specks of dust 

129

and they were through it  whether it had taken a minute or half an hour they
werent sure, but they were through it and confronted with a fresh blankness,
as if space were pinched out of existence in front of them 
a blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode from out of the block which
had risen three feet out of the ground, and out of that rose a smaller perspex
block, dazzling with interior dancing colours 
the block was slotted with deep groves, three upright and two across, clearly
designed to accept the wikkit key 
as space unpinched itself, it seemed agonizingly to twist the eyes of the watch-
ers in their sockets  they found themselves staring, blinded, at an unravelled
sun which stood now before them where it seemed only seconds before there
had not been even empty space  it was harsh, it was cold, it was empty, it was me-
chanically dismal 
zaphod beeblebrox, the only man in history to survive a direct blast attack
from the krikkit robots, ran out of the krikkit warship brandishing a zap gun 
the single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung his battle-
club, and connected it with the back of zaphods left head 
who the zark did that? said the left head, and lolled sickeningly forward 
zaphod measured his length as a rather strange shape on the ground  the robots marched grimly and, it almost
seemed, in a slightly disheartened manner, back into their warship which, with
a foop, was gone 
trillian and ford ran hectically round and down the steep incline to the dark,
still body of zaphod beeblebrox 



i dont know, said zaphod, for what seemed to him like the thirty-seventh
time, they could have killed me, but they didnt 
zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight deck  his back seemed to wrestle
the floor as pain thudded through him and banged at his heads 
i think, he whispered, that there is something wrong with those anodized
dudes, something fundamentally weird 
they are programmed to kill everybody, slartibartfast pointed out 
that, wheezed zaphod between the whacking thuds, could be it  he didnt
seem altogether convinced 
yeah, he said, im fine  she stared at the huge visiscreen
over the flight couches and, twisting a switch, she flipped local images over it 
one image was the blankness of the dust cloud  one was the sun of krikkit 
one was krikkit itself 
well, thats goodbye galaxy, then, said arthur, slapping his knees and
standing up 
once again, he said, we have failed pathetically  quite pathetically 132

chapter 25 

that, said ford quietly, is because we dont care enough 
but unless we determine to take action, said the old man querulously, as if
struggling against something deeply insouciant in his nature, then we shall
all be destroyed, we shall all die 
slartibartfast clearly found this point of view extremely seductive and he
fought against it  he turned again to zaphod who was gritting his teeth
and sweating with the pain 
i kind of think they didnt even know, shrugged zaphod  it was the gold
bail - the heart of gold, the heart of the infinite improbability drive 
will you not help us? said slartibartfast 
id love to stay and help you save the galaxy, insisted zaphod, rising him-
self up on to his shoulders, but i have the mother and father of a pair of
headaches, and i feel a lot of little headaches coming on  but next time it
needs saving, im your guy  hey, trillian baby?
she looked round briefly 
yes?
you want to come? heart of gold? excitement and adventure and really
wild things?
im going down to krikkit, she said  this was krikkit itself and they
were standing on it  near them, behind the trees, stood the strange italian
restaurant which had brought these, their real bodies, to this, the real, present
world of krikkit 
krikkit 
possibly the most dangerous place in the galaxy for anyone who isnt a
krikkiter to stand 
slartibartfast shuddered  but when they had returned zaphod to his ship ford had felt unexpect-
edly shamed into not running away  he hugged to himself one
of the zap guns with which they had armed themselves out of zaphods ar-
moury 
trillian shuddered, and frowned as she looked into the sky 
whilst the countryside around them had changed little in the two thousand
years of the krikkit wars, and the mere five years that had elapsed locally
since krikkit was sealed in its slo-time envelope ten billion years ago, the sky
was dramatically different 134

chapter 26 
high in the sky, where no krikkiter ever looked, were the war zones, the robot
zones - huge warships and tower blocks floating in the nil-o-grav fields far
above the idyllic pastoral lands of the surface of krikkit 
trillian stared at them and thought 
trillian, whispered ford prefect to her 
do you always breathe like that when youre thinking?
i wasnt aware that i was breathing 
thats what worried me  said trillian 
shhhh! said slartibartfast in alarm, and his thin trembling hand motioned
them further back beneath the shadow of the tree  arthur was clenched with a claus-
trophobic terror and the warm wind caught at his throat  they
were converging deliberately on the spot where arthur and the others were
standing 
arthur heard the slight rustle as ford prefect raised his zap gun to his shoul-
der, and the slight whimpering cough as slartibartfast raised his 
his fingers fumbled to release the safety catch and engage the extreme dan-
ger catch as ford had shown him  he was shaking so much that if hed fired
at anybody at that moment he probably would have burnt his signature on
them 
only trillian didnt raise her gun 
a light stabbed through the darkness from behind them and they span around

to find a third party of krikkiters behind them, searching them out with their
torches 
ford prefects gun crackled viciously, but fire spat back at it and it crashed
from his hands 
they were surrounded by pale-faced krikkiters and bathed in bobbing torch
light  aliens?

136

chapter 26 



meanwhile, more millions of miles away than the mind can comfortably en-
compass, zaphod beeblebrox was throwing a mood again 
he had repaired his ship - that is, hed watched with alert interest whilst a
service robot had repaired it for him  he fiddled with a book, and then tossed it away  it was the one hed
read before 
got any mixers? said zaphod 
ok, ok, said zaphod and flipped the channel shut again  little blobs started to rush around the screen eating each other 
pow! said zaphod 
ok, ok, said zaphod and flipped the screen blank again 



tell us, said the thin, pale-faced krikkiter who had stepped forward from
the ranks of the others and stood uncertainly in the circle of torchlight, han-
dling his gun as if he was just holding it for someone else whod just popped
off somewhere but would be back in a minute, do you know anything about
something called the balance of nature?
there was no reply from their captives, or at least nothing more articulate
than a few confused mumbles and grunts  the torchlight continued to play
over them 
its just, continued the krikkiter uneasily, something we heard about, prob-
ably nothing important 
that is, he said, looking up again, unless theres anything you want to chat
about?
slow, numb astonishment crept up the bodies of slartibartfast, ford and
arthur  very soon it would reach their brains, which were at the moment
solely occupied with moving their jawbones up and down  trillian was shak-
ing her head as if trying to finish a jigsaw by shaking the box  this got a cheer of approval from the oth-
ers  he seemed to be wrestling with some deep140

chapter 28 

inner confusion, as if everything he wanted to say and everything he thought
were entirely different things, between which he could see no possible connec-
tion 
wh   said slartibartfast  wh  
hhhh  
dr   said ford prefect 
ok, said trillian  she walked forward and took
the poor confused krikkiter by the arm  he looked about twenty-five, which
meant, because of the peculiar manglings of time that had been going on in
this area, that he would have been just twenty when the krikkit wars were
finished, ten billion years ago 
trillian led him for a short walk through the torchlight before she said any-
thing more  the encircling torch beams
were drooping now slightly as if they were abdicating to this strange, quiet
girl who alone in the universe of dark confusion seemed to know what she was
doing 
he said nothing for a moment, whilst his gaze darted from one of her eyes to
the other 
he goggled at her as if shed said something very strange about beetroots  will that make us alone? i
dont know 
trillian slowly put her arms around the poor bewildered young krikkiter and
patted his trembling head on her shoulder 
its all right, she said quietly but clearly enough for all the shadowy crowd
to hear, you dont have to do it 
you dont have to do it, she said again 



zaphod beeblebrox crawled bravely along a tunnel, like the hell of a guy he
was 
he was in the robot war zones many miles above the surface of the planet
krikkit 
he had parked the starship heart of gold amongst the huge jostling dim hulks
that crowded the sky here above krikkit, and had entered what appeared to
be the biggest and most important of the sky buildings, armed with nothing
but a zap gun and something for his headaches  he hid be-
cause every now and then one of the krikkit robots would walk along it, and
although he had so far led some kind of charmed life at their hands, it had
nevertheless been an extremely painful one, and he had no desire to stretch
what he was only half-inclined to call his good fortune 
it was terribly burnt and mangled, and, now that he had caught up with some
of the galactic history he had missed through his failed attempts to have sex
with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him at school, he was able to put
in an intelligent guess that this was the wrecked spaceship which had drifted
through the dust cloud all those billions of years ago and started the whole144

chapter 29  in other words it was a
very useful thing to have around if you suddenly decided to build a spaceship
yourself and didnt know how to do it 
he was still puzzling over this - in fact hed only just started to puzzle over
it - when he became aware that a door had slid open in another part of the
chamber, and another couple of krikkit robots had entered, looking a little
glum 
zaphod did not want to tangle with them and, deciding that just as discretion
was the better part of valour so was cowardice the better part of discretion,
he valiantly hid himself in a cupboard 
he didnt like it 
this time he emerged into a smaller chamber, which appeared to be a com-
puter intelligence centre  theres something wrong with them 
what, exactly?
these were the voices of two war command krikkiters  all the war com-
manders lived up in the sky in the robot war zones, and were largely immune
to the whimsical doubts and uncertainties which were afflicting their fellows
down on the surface of the planet 
well, sir i think its just as well that they are being phased out of the war
effort, and that we are now going to detonate the supernova bomb 
the robots arent enjoying it, sir  theres a certain world-
weariness about them, or perhaps i should say universe-weariness 
well, thats all right, theyre meant to be helping to destroy it 
yes, well theyre finding it difficult, sir  they are afflicted with a certain las-
situde  theyre just finding it hard to get behind the job  they lack oomph 
what are you trying to say?
well, i think theyre very depressed about something, sir 
what on krikkit are you talking about?
well, in the few skirmishes theyve had recently, it seems that they go into
battle, raise their weapons to fire and suddenly think, why bother? what,
cosmically speaking, is it all about? and they just seem to get a little tired
and a little grim  fiendishly difficult ones by all accounts 
and then they sulk 
whoever heard of a robot sulking?
i dont know, sir 
what was that noise?
it was the noise of zaphod leaving with his head spinning 

146

chapter 29  it had been silent in its metal-
lic darkness for some time 
its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core of the krikkit
war computer  it wasnt enjoying the experience, and neither was the central
intelligence core of the krikkit war computer 
the krikkit robots which had salvaged this pathetic metal creature from the
swamps of squornshellous zeta had recognized almost immediately its gigantic
intelligence, and the use which this could be to them 
they hadnt reckoned with the attendant personality disorders, which the cold-
ness, the darkness, the dampness, the crampedness and the loneliness were
doing nothing to decrease  having solved all the major mathematical,
physical, chemical, biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological, mete-
orological and psychological problems of the universe except his own, three
times over, he was severely stuck for something to do, and had taken up com-
posing short dolorous ditties of no tone, or indeed tune 
now the world has gone to bed, marvin droned,
darkness wont engulf my head,
i can see by infra-red,
how i hate the night 148

chapter 30 
his head snapped up, almost dislodging the intricate network of electrodes
which connected him to the central krikkit war computer 
an inspection hatch had opened and one of a pair of unruly heads was peering
through whilst the other kept on jogging it by continually darting to look this
way and that extremely nervously 
hey, kid, said zaphod in astonishment, was that you singing just then?
i am, marvin acknowledged bitterly, in particularly scintillating form at
the moment 
zaphod poked his head in through the hatchway and looked around 
yeah, said zaphod  hey, whats your connection with all this?
this, said marvin, indicating with his less damaged arm all the electrodes
which connected him with the krikkit computer 
then, said zaphod awkwardly, i guess you must have saved my life 
zaphods head snapped round (his other one was looking hawkishly in entirely
the wrong direction) just in time to see the lethal killer robot directly behind
him seize up and start to smoke  it slipped sideways, threw its head back and started to
sob inconsolably 
zaphod looked back at marvin 
just dont even ask, said marvin 
i wont, said zaphod, and didnt  hey look, he added, youre doing a
terrific job 
which means, i suppose, said marvin, requiring only one ten thousand mil-
lion billion trillion grillionth part of his mental powers to make this particular
logical leap, that youre not going to release me or anything like that 
kid, you know id love to 
but youre not going to 

149

youre working well  why stop now just when im hating it?
i got to find trillian and the guys 
they are very close, said marvin dolefully 
i better go get them, asserted zaphod  er, maybe they need some help,
right?
maybe, said marvin with unexpected authority in his lugubrious voice, it
would be better if you monitored them from here  that young girl, he added
unexpectedly, is one of the least benightedly unintelligent life forms it has
been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting 
zaphod took a moment or two to find his way through this labyrinthine string
of negatives and emerged at the other end with surprise  shes just a kid  cute, yeah, but temperamental  or perhaps you dont  i assume you dont  if you
do i dont want to hear about it 
what? said zaphod 
it was trillian speaking 
the wall against which the krikkit robot was sobbing had lit up to reveal
a scene taking place in some other unknown part of the krikkit robot war
zones  it seemed to be a council chamber of some kind - zaphod couldnt make
it out too clearly because of the robot slumped against the screen 
just think about it, said trillians voice, your history is just a series of
freakishly improbable events 
zaphod was mad with frustration because he couldnt see the screen  the
robots head was obscuring his view of the people trillian as talking to, his
multi-functional battleclub was obscuring the background, and the elbow of
the arm it had pressed tragically against its brow was obscuring trillian her-
self  thats
really likely, isnt it? have you any idea of what the odds are against a drifting
spaceship accidentally intersecting with the orbit of a planet?
hey, said zaphod, she doesnt know what the zark shes talking about  ive
seen that spaceship 

i thought it might be, said marvin from his prison behind zaphod 
oh yeah, said zaphod  any-
way, i dont see what its got to do with anything 
and especially, continued trillian, the odds against it intersecting with the
orbit of the one planet in the galaxy, or the whole of the universe as far as
i know, that would be totally traumatized to see it  you dont know what
the odds are? nor do i, theyre that big  i wouldnt be
surprised if that spaceship was just a fake 
zaphod managed to move the robots battleclub  behind it on the screen were
the figures of ford, arthur and slartibartfast who appeared astonished and
bewildered by the whole thing 
hey, look, said zaphod excitedly 
i know, i know, she added in response to an unseen interruption, i know
you didnt realize it was going on  like this supernova bomb 
i just know, said trillian  you expect me to believe that you are bright
enough to invent something that brilliant and be too dumb to realize it would
take you with it as well? thats not just stupid, that is spectacularly obtuse 
hey, whats this bomb thing? said zaphod in alarm to marvin 
the supernova bomb? said marvin 
why not, if its so brilliant?
its brilliant, said marvin, theyre not  theyve spent the last five years building
it  they think theyve got it right but they havent  theyre as stupid as any
other organic life form 
trillian was continuing 
zaphod tried to pull the krikkit robot away by its leg, but it kicked and
growled at him, and then quaked with a fresh outburst of sobbing  then sud-
denly it slumped over and continued to express its feelings out of everybodys
way on the floor 
trillian was standing alone in the middle of the chamber tired out but with

151

fiercely burning eyes 
in front of them, equidistant between their control desk and the middle of the
chamber, where trillian stood, as if on trial, was a slim white pillar about
four feet tall 
beside it stood a krikkit robot with its multi-functional battleclub  za-
phod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her to be doing at this point)
you are all so dumb stupid that i doubt, i very much doubt, that youve been
able to build the bomb properly without any help from hactar for the last five
years 
whos this guy hactar? said zaphod, squaring his shoulders 
if marvin replied, zaphod didnt hear him 
one of the elders of krikkit made a small motion with his hand towards the
krikkit robot 
theres nothing i can do, said marvin 
wait, said trillian  trillian suddenly seemed
very doubtful of her own judgment 
how do you know all this? said zaphod to marvin at this point 
youre very different, arent you, said trillian to the elder masters, from
your fellow worldlings down on the ground  youve spent all your lives up here,
unprotected by the atmosphere  youve been very vulnerable  the rest of your
race is very frightened, you know, they dont want you to do this  youre out
of touch, why dont you check up?
the krikkit elder grew impatient 
the robot swung its battleclub 
the small white globe was the supernova bomb 
the supernova bomb flew through the air 
so how does she know all this? said zaphod 

152

chapter 30 
probably just bluffing, said zaphod 



hactar! called trillian  trillian waited, nervously 
she was sure that she couldnt be wrong 
i wanted to go off with a thunder god, but he wouldnt let me and i appre-
ciate that  unfortunately
zaphod is too frightened by all this, so i brought arthur instead  im not sure
why im telling you all this  i promise that you will be per-
fectly safe 
arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her, but she wouldnt let
him  he held on to his airline hold-all with its tin of greek olive oil, its towel,
its crumpled postcards of santorini and its other odds and ends  in reducing the computer to dust the154

chapter 31 

silastic armorfiends of striterax had merely crippled the computer, not killed
it 
arthur and trillian stood, or rather floated, in the middle of this bizarre en-
tity  hactar kept his promise 
i have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality, said hactar faintly, but
tricks of the light 
arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa which had ap-
peared to him in the fields of prehistoric earth  he wanted to shout and shake
with rage that the universe kept doing these insanely bewildering things to
him  trillian sat on
it too 
at least, if it wasnt real, it did support them, and as that is what sofas are
supposed to do, this, by any test that mattered, was a real sofa 
arthur quickly pointed out that he hadnt deduced anything much himself,
trillian was the one  she had simply asked him along because he was inter-
ested in life, the universe, and everything 
that is something in which i too am interested, breathed hactar  hactar obviously noticed this 
around them, to complete the setting, was the hazy suggestion of wood-
panelled walls  and then, on the couch, appeared the image of hactar himself,
and it was an eye-twisting image 
all right, said trillian firmly  can you construct real things too? i mean solid ob-
jects?
again there was a pause before the answer, as if the pulverized mind of hactar
had to collect its thoughts from the millions and millions of miles over which
it was scattered 
the image of hactar on the couch seemed to billow and waver, as if finding it
hard to maintain itself  i can tease them into shape, but it takes
many aeons 
so, did you make, asked trillian again, the model of the wrecked space-
craft?
er   yes, murmured hactar 

the mist of hactars ancient shattered mind swirled about them as if uneasy
dreams were moving through it 
i repented, you see, he murmured dolefully  i repented of sabotaging my
own design for the silastic armorfiends  i negated my
own existence 
hactar sighed, and they waited in silence for him to continue his story  i deliberately nurtured the planet of
krikkit till they would arrive at the same state of mind as the silastic ar-
morfiends, and require of me the design of the bomb i failed to make the first
time 
there was also the matter of revenge, of course, said hactar, with a sharp-
ness which was new in his voice 
trillian said, does it worry you that you have failed?
have i failed? whispered hactar  the image of the computer on the psychi-
atrists couch began slowly to fade again  no, failure doesnt bother
me now 
you know what we have to do? said trillian, her voice cold and businesslike 
yes, said hactar, youre going to disperse me  if i havent already fulfilled my function, then its too late now  arthur and tril-
lian made their curious way back into the heart of gold  a few last licks
and they were gone, leaving him with just a pile of ashes, where a few minutes
previously there had been the wooden pillar of nature and spirituality 
he scooped them off the hob of the heart of golds gamma barbecue, put
them in a paper bag, and walked back into the bridge 
he had already had an argument with slartibartfast on this matter, and even-
tually the old man had got annoyed and left 
the argument had arisen because arthurs idea of returning the ashes to
lords cricket ground at the same moment that they were originally taken
would involve travelling back in time a day or so, and this was precisely the
sort of gratuitous and irresponsible mucking about that the campaign for real
time was trying to put a stop to 
ford, zaphod and trillian were watching the visiscreens intently as hactar was
dispersing under pressure from a vibration field which the heart of gold was
pumping into it 
i thought i heard it say, said trillian in a puzzle voice, whats done is
done  
smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the wake of the theft of the
ashes by the krikkit robots  through the smoke, people were running panic-
stricken, colliding with each other, tripping over stretchers, being arrested 
one policeman was attempting to arrest wowbagger the infinitely prolonged
for insulting behaviour, but was unable to prevent the tall grey-green alien
from returning to his ship and arrogantly flying away, thus causing even more
panic and pandemonium 
in the middle of this, for the second time that afternoon, the figures of arthur
dent and ford prefect suddenly materialized, they had teleported down out
of the heart of gold which was now in parking orbit round the planet  i have the ashes! theyre in this bag 
i dont think you have their attention, said ford 
i have also helped save the universe, called arthur to anyone who was pre-
pared to listen, in other words no one  ive got them  ive got them in this bag  they were part of the
key to the slo-time envelope, you see, and, well, anyway you can guess the
rest, the point is ive got them and what should i do with them?
the policeman told him, but arthur could only assume that he was speaking
metaphorically 
he wandered about disconsolately  a man rushed past him and jogged his
elbow, he dropped the paper bag and it spilt its contents all over the ground 
can you tell me later?
i had a passion for cricket, you know, but i wasnt very good at it 
he looked around him at the panicstricken throng 
he had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it wasnt the
same bag that hed had at the time  the birds were wheeling about it, a few white
clouds scudded across it 
he turned and pawed a couple of times at the ground with his bedroom slip-
pers 
as he ran, he saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman  the batsman
standing ready at the wicket was not one of the england cricket team  it was one of the robot krikkit team 
quite a few thoughts collided in arthur dents mind at tis moment, but he
didnt seem to be able to stop running  time seemed to be going terribly,
terribly slowly, but still he didnt seem to be able to stop running 
he looked at the krikkit robot again standing implacably still and purpose-
fully in front of him, battleclub raised in readiness 
some of the thoughts which were colliding in his mind at this time were these:
he felt a hell of a fool 
he felt that he should have listened rather more carefully to a number of things
he had heard said, phrases which now pounded round in his mind as his feet
pounded onwards to the point where he would inevitably release the ball to
the krikkit robot, who would inevitably strike it 
he remembered hactar saying, have i failed? failure doesnt bother me 
he remembered the account of hactars dying words, whats done is done, i
have fulfilled my function 
he remembered hactar saying that he had managed to make a few things 
he also remembered that he wasnt a very good bowler 
he felt his arm coming round, gripping tightly on to the ball which he now
knew for certain was the supernova bomb that hactar had built himself and
planted on him, the bomb which would cause the universe to come to an
abrupt and premature end 
he hoped and prayed that there wasnt an afterlife  then he realized there was
a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasnt an afterlife 
he hoped, he hoped, he hoped that his bowling was as bad as he remembered
it to be, because that seemed to be the only thing now standing between this
moment and universal oblivion 

necting with the airline hold-all hed stupidly left lying on the ground in front
of him, he felt himself falling heavily forward but, having his mind so terribly
full of other things at this moment, he completely forgot about hitting the
ground and didnt 
still holding the ball firmly in his right hand he soared up into the air whim-
pering with surprise 
he twisted down towards the ground, flinging himself hectically through the
air, at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off into the distance  it still had its multi-
functional battleclub raised, but had suddenly been deprived of anything to
hit 
with a sudden mad access of strength, he wrestled the battleclub from the grip
of the startled robot, executed a dazzling banking turn in the air, hurtled back
down in a furious power-drive and with one crazy swing knocked the robots
head from the robots shoulders  he said that the bistromathic
drive had revealed to him that time and distance were one, that mind and
universe were one, that perception and reality were one, and that the more
one travelled the more one stayed in one place, and that what with one thing
and another he would rather just stay put for a while and sort it all out in his
mind, which was now at one with the universe so it shouldnt take too long,
and he could get a good rest afterwards, put in a little flying practice and
learn to cook which he had always meant to do 
he yawned and fell asleep 
in the morning as they prepared to take him to some quiet and idyllic planet
where they wouldnt mind him talking like that they suddenly picked up a
computer-driven distress call and diverted to investigate 
a small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the merida class seemed to
be dancing a strange little jig through the void 
he was a journalist with the siderial daily mentioner  they sedated him and
sent marvin in to keep him company until he promised to try and talk sense 
i was covering a trial, he said at last, on argabuthon  trillian put a soothing hand on his shoulder  called prak  they were even-
tually forced to administer a drug to make him tell the truth, a truth drug  i thing the robots must have jogged the sur-
geons arm 
robots? said zaphod sharply  what robots?
some white robots, whispered the man hoarsely, broke into the courtroom
and stole the judges sceptre, the argabuthon sceptre of justice, nasty per-
spex thing  i dont know why they wanted it  and
i think they jogged the surgeons arm  
and when the trial continued, he said in a weeping whisper, they asked
prak a most unfortunate thing  only, dont you
see?
he suddenly hoisted himself up on to his elbows again and shouted at them 
theyd given him much too much of the drug!
he collapsed again, moaning quietly 
what happened? said zaphod at last 
oh, he told it all right, said the man savagely, for all i know hes still telling
it now  im a journalist 
he collapsed into a coma from which he recovered only once and briefly 
on that one occasion, they discovered from him the following:
when it became clear that prak could not be stopped, that here was truth in
its absolute and final form, the court was cleared 
not only cleared, it was sealed up, with prak still in it  steel walls were

165

erected around it, and, just to be on the safe side, barbed wire, electric fences,
crocodile swamps and three major armies were installed, so that no one would
ever have to hear prak speak 
thats a pity, said arthur  id like to hear what he had to say 
arthur told the computer the telephone number of kings cross railway sta-
tion passenger inquiries, on the grounds that it must have some function, and
this might turn out to be it 
the computer injected the number into the ships reconstituted improbability
drive 
the heart of gold told space to get knotted, and parked itself neatly within
the inner steel perimeter of the argabuthon chamber of law  you wouldnt hold a dinner
party here - at least, not a successful one 
the ceilings were high, vaulted and very dark  the panelling for the walls and benches, the cladding of
the heavy pillars, all were carved from the darkest and most severe trees in
the fearsome forest of arglebard  if a sunbeam
had ever managed to slink this far into the justice complex of argabuthon it
would have turned around and slunk straight back out again 
arthur and trillian were the first in, whilst ford and zaphod bravely kept a
watch on their rear  their footsteps echoed hollowly
round the chamber  all the defences were still in position
and operative around the outside of the building, they had run scan checks 
prak was lounging on a bench, smoking a listless cigarette 
he was a little man with scraggy hair 
whats going on? said trillian 
nothing, said the man and jiggled his shoulders 
arthur shone his torch full on praks face 
oh, that, said prak  theres not nearly as much
of it as people imagine 
he suddenly exploded in about three seconds of manical laughter and stopped
again 
ford and zaphod came forward out of the shadows 
oh, i cant remember any of it now, said prak  i thought of writing some
of it down, but first i couldnt find a pencil, and then i thought, why bother?
there was a long silence, during which they thought they could feel the uni-
verse age a little  prak stared into the torchlight  anyway, who are you
guys?
we came to find you, said trillian, deliberately not keeping the disappoint-
ment out of her voice  my name is trillian 
prak jiggled his head 
ford prefect, said ford prefect with a shrug 
prak jiggled his head 
and i, said zaphod, when he judged that the silence was once again deep
enough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be tossed in lightly, am
zaphod beeblebrox 
prak jiggled his head 
whos this guy? said prak jiggling his shoulder at arthur, who was standing
silent for a moment, lost in disappointed thoughts 

167

praks eyes popped out of his head  you are arthur dent? the arthur dent?
he staggered backwards, clutching his stomach and convulsed with fresh parox-
ysms o laughter 
he hollered and yelled in hysterics 
arthur stood there with his lips twitching whilst the others carried prak co-
matose on to the ship 
the others nodded in silence, a silence which was only slightly undermined
by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical laughter which came
drifting from praks cabin at the farthest end of the ship 
we have questioned him, continued arthur, or at least, you have questioned
him - i, as you know, cant go near him - on everything, and he doesnt really
seem to have anything to contribute  just the occasional snippet, and things
i dont want to hear about frogs 
prak was quiet  for days they had lived with constant manical laughter ring-
ing round the ship, only occasionally relieved by short periods of light giggling
and sleep  arthurs very soul was clenched with paranoia  a buzzer sounded  a glance at a board told
them that the buzzer had been sounded by prak 
hes not well, said trillian quietly 
arthurs lips twitched but he said nothing 
wed better go and see him, said trillian 
trillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face  he thrust his hands deep into his dressing-gown pockets and
tried to think of something to say which wouldnt sound petty 

ribly unfair, but he couldnt 
please, said trillian 
he shrugged and went in, taking his glum and tight-lipped face with him, de-
spite the reaction this always provoked from prak  ford and zaphod were standing by
the bed looking awkward 
you wanted to ask me something, said prak in a thin voice and coughed
slightly 
prak shrugged weakly  cos its true, he said simply  i wanted to know what the ques-
tion was 
prak nodded sympathetically, and arthur relaxed a little  all we know is
that the answer is forty-two, which is a little aggravating 
prak nodded again  yes, thats right 
im afraid, he said at last, that the question and the answer are mutually
exclusive  knowledge of one logically precludes knowledge of the other  disappointment crept into arthurs face and snuggled down
into its accustomed place 
except, said prak, struggling to sort a thought out, if it happened, it seems
that the question and the answer would just cancel each other out and take
the universe with them, which would then be replaced by something even more
bizarrely inexplicable 
do you know, said prak, the story of the reason?
arthur said that he didnt, and prak said that he knew that he didnt 
primitive tribesmen who were sitting huddled on the cold hillsides looked up
from their steaming night-drinks and pointed with trembling fingers, swearing
that they had seen a sign, a sign from their gods which meant that they must
now arise at last and go and slay the evil princes of the plains 
in the high turrets of their palaces, the princes of the plains looked up and saw
the shining star, and received it unmistakably as a sign from their gods that
they must now go and set about the accursed tribesmen of the cold hillsides 
when in the land there was born at some time in the afternoon a perfectly
normal cat or pig with no birth complications at all, or even just a child with
a retrousse nose, that too would often be taken as a sign 
so there was no doubt at all that a new star in the sky was a sign of a partic-
ularly spectacular order 
and each new sign signified the same thing - that the princes of the plains
and the tribesmen of the cold hillsides were about to beat the hell out of
each other again 
this in itself wouldnt be so bad, except that the princes of the plains and
the tribesmen of the cold hillsides always elected to beat the hell out of each
other in the forest, and it was always the dwellers in the forest who came off
worst in these exchanges, though as far as they could see it never had anything
to do with them 
and sometimes, after some of the worst of these outrages, the dwellers in the
forest would send a messenger to either the leader of the princes of the plains
or the leader of the tribesmen of the cold hillsides and demand to know the
reason for this intolerable behaviour  the messenger would hang his head and feel sad and foolish
that he had not realized what a tough and complex place the real world was,
and what difficulties and paradoxes had to be embraced if one was to live in
it 
the messenger would nod dumbly 
and why they have to take place in the forest, and why it is in everybodys
best interest, the forest dwellers included, that they should?
er   what it actually was he couldnt
remember at all 
prak paused in his story and coughed pathetically 
i was the messenger, he said, after the battles precipitated by the appear-
ance of your ship, which were particularly savage  would you like to
hear it?
for a moment they didnt know whether to take him seriously  his head lolled slightly 
i wasnt very impressed with it when i first knew what it was, he said, but
now i think back to how impressed i was by the princes reason, and how soon
afterwards i couldnt recall it at all, i think it might be a lot more helpful 

171

would you like to know what it is? would you?
they nodded dumbly  if youre that interested i suggest you go and look for it  it
is written in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on top of the quentulus quazgar
mountains in the land of sevorbeupstry on the planet preliumtarn, third out
from the sun zarss in galactic sector qq7 active j gamma  it is guarded by
the lajestic vantrashell of lob 
it is written, repeated prak, in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on top of
the quentulus quazgar mountains in the land of sevorbeupstry on the planet
preliumtarn, third out from the  
sorry, said arthur again, which mountains?
the quentulus quazgar mountains in the land of sevorbeupstry on the planet
 
which land was that? i didnt quite catch it 
sevorbe-what?
oh, for heavens sake, said prak and died testily 
he learnt to communicate with birds and discovered that their conversation
was fantastically boring  unfortunately, he discovered,
once you have learnt birdspeak you quickly come to realize that the air is full
of it the whole time, just inane bird chatter 
for that reason arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to live on the
ground and love it, despite a lot of the inane chatter he heard down there as
well 
one day, he was walking through the fields humming a ravishing tune hed
heard recently when a silver spaceship descended from the sky and landed in
front of him 
arthur phili  
ive done you before havent i? he said 

so long, and thanks for all the fish

introduction

far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western
spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun  many solutions were
suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the
movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole
it wasnt the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy 
many were increasingly of the opinion that theyd all made a big mistake in
coming down from the trees in the first place 
and then, one thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been
nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a
change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in rickmansworth suddenly
realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally
knew how the world could be made a good and happy place 
sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a ter-
ribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever 
there was nobody around to see it except some spectacularly stupid quadrupeds
who hadnt the faintest idea what to make of it, or whether they were meant
to make anything of it, or eat it, or what 
youd probably guessed that anyway  the census report, like most such sur-
veys, had cost an awful lot of money and didnt tell anybody anything they
didnt already know - except that every single person in the galaxy had 2 
the craft slid quietly down through the rain, its dim operating lights wrapping
it in tasteful rainbows  it hummed very quietly, a hum which became gradu-
ally louder and deeper as it approached the ground, and which at an altitude
of six inches became a heavy throb  he glanced up apprehensively,
and in response to a sudden thought quickly started to rummage through the
large plastic shopping bag, which he now discovered had a hole in the bottom 
it had large characters printed on the side which read (to anyone who could de-
cipher the centaurian alphabet) duty free mega- market, port brasta, alpha
centauri 
lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a moment,
and then hurry onwards, revising his path to give the trees a wide berth  he
moved swiftly across the ground, slipping here and there, hunching himself
against the rain which was falling now with ever-increasing concentration, as
if being pulled from the sky  he point-
lessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on 
not lightning this time, but more diffused and dimmer lights which played
slowly over the horizon and faded  it
was a low bulbous shape, like a small whale surfing - sleek, grey and rounded
and moving at terrifying speed 
to the figures apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read, my other
car is also a porsche 



rob mckeena was a miserable bastard and he knew it because hed had a lot
of people point it out to him over the years and he saw no reason to disagree
with them except the obvious one which was that he liked disagreeing with
people, particularly people he disliked, which included, at the last count, ev-
eryone 
the hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with danish ther-
mostatic radiator controls 
it wasnt that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly, at least he hoped
not  so they would distinguish between thin snow and thick
snow, light snow and heavy snow, sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came
in flurries, snow that came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your
neighbours boots all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the
snows of spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so
much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, hill
snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls at night,
snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out fishing, and snow
that despite all your efforts to train them, the huskies have pissed on 
rob mckeena had two hundred and thirty-one different types of rain entered
in his little book, and he didnt like any of them 
he shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up  it grumbled in
a comfortable sort of way about all the danish thermostatic radiator controls10

chapter 2 
since he had left denmark the previous afternoon, he had been through types
33 (light pricking drizzle which made the roads slippery), 39 ( heavy spotting),
47 to 51 (vertical light drizzle through to sharply slanting light to moderate
drizzle freshening), 87 and 88 (two finely distinguished varieties of vertical
torrential downpour), 100 (post-downpour squalling, cold), all the seastorm
types between 192 and 213 at once, 123, 124, 126, 127 (mild and intermediate
cold gusting, regular and syncopated cab-drumming), 11 (breezy droplets),
and now his least favourite of all, 17 
rain type 17 was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen so hard that
it didnt make much odds whether he had his wipers on or off 
in fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off 
swish swish swish flop swish flop swish swish flop swish flop swish flop flop
flop scrape 
he pounded his steering wheel, kicked the floor, thumped his cassette player
till it suddenly started playing barry manilow, thumped it again till it stopped,
and swore and swore and swore and swore and swore 
it was at the very moment that his fury was peaking that there loomed swim-
mingly in his headlights, hardly visible through the blatter, a figure by the
roadside 
poor miserable sod, thought rob mckeena to himself, realizing that here
was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than himself, must be
chilled to the bone  all
you get is cold, wet, and lorries driving through puddles at you 
see what i mean? he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly through it 
at least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that porsche he had
been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles 

and as he drove on, the rainclouds dragged down the sky after him, for, though
he did not know it, rob mckeena was a rain god 



the next two lorries were not driven by rain gods, but they did exactly the
same thing 
a renault drove by, and its driver made frantic and complex signals to the
trudging figure to indicate that he would have been delighted to give the figure
a lift, only he couldnt this time because he wasnt going in the direction that
the figure wanted to go, whatever direction that might be, and he was sure the
figure would understand  he concluded the signalling with a cheery thumbs-
up sign, as if to say that he hoped the figure felt really fine about being cold
and almost terminally wet, and he would catch him the next time around  a fiat passed and did exactly the same as the re-
nault 
a maxi passed on the other side of the road and flashed its lights at the
slowly plodding figure, though whether this was meant to convey a hello or
a sorry were going the other way or a hey look, theres someone in the
rain, what a jerk was entirely unclear  a green strip across the top of the
windscreen indicated that whatever the message was, it came from steve and
carola  twenty
minutes after admitting hes lost the argument  opposite the turning stood a signpost which the
figure suddenly hurried to and studied with feverish curiosity, only twisting14

chapter 3 
the first whisked by with complete disregard, the second flashed meaning-
lessly  a ford cortina passed and put on its brakes 
lurching with surprise, the figure bundled his bag to his chest and hurried
forward towards the car, but at the last moment the cortina span its wheels
in the wet and carreered off up the road rather amusingly 
the figure slowed to a stop and stood there, lost and dejected 
as it chanced, the following day the driver of the cortina went into hospital
to have his appendix out, only due to a rather amusing mix up the surgeon
removed his leg in error, and before the appendectomy could be rescheduled,
the appendicitis complicated into an entertainingly serious case of peritonitis
and justice, in its way, was served 
a saab drew to a halt beside him 
the figure, the car and its door handle were all on a planet called the earth, a
world whose entire entry in the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy comprised
the two words mostly harmless 



whether it was because he was drunk, ill or suicidally insane would not have
been apparent to a casual observer, and indeed there were no casual observers
in the old pink dog bar on the lower south side of han dold city because it
wasnt the sort of place you could afford to do things casually in if you wanted
to stay alive  any observers in the place would have been mean hawklike ob-
servers, heavily armed, with painful throbbings in their heads which caused
them to do crazy things when they observed things they didnt like 
one of those nasty hushes had descended on the place, a sort of missile crisis
sort of hush 
all eyes were on ford prefect  some of them were on stalks  the ex-
piration date? have you guys never heard of neo-relativity out here? theres
whole new areas of physics which can take care of this sort of thing  time
dilation effects, temporal relastatics  
we are not worried about the expiration date, said the man to whom he
addressed these remarks, who was a dangerous barman in a dangerous city 
his voice was a low soft purr, like the low soft purr made by the opening of an
icbm silo 
well, thats good then, said ford, packing his satchel and preparing to leave 

fect 
although the finger was attached to a slablike hand, and the hand was at-
tached to a clublike forearm, the forearm wasnt attached to anything at all,
except in the metaphorical sense that it was attached by a fierce doglike loyalty
to the bar which was its home  it had previously been more conventionally at-
tached to the original owner of the bar, who on his deathbed had unexpectedly
bequeathed it to medical science  medical science had decided they didnt like
the look of it and had bequeathed it right back to the old pink dog bar 
the new barman didnt believe in the supernatural or poltergeists or anything
kooky like that, he just knew an useful ally when he saw one  it took orders, it served drinks, it dealt murderously with people
who behaved as if they wanted to be murdered  ford prefect sat still 
we are not worried about the expiration date, repeated the barman, sat-
isfied that he now had ford prefects full attention 
this, said the barman, holding out the card as if it was a small fish whose
soul had three weeks earlier winged its way to the land where fish are eter-
nally blessed, we dont accept it 
ford wondered briefly whether to raise the fact that he didnt have any other
means of payment on him, but decided for the moment to soldier on 
but you dont understand, said ford, his expression slowly ripening from
a little taken abackness into rank incredulity  havent you read
their junk mail?
the cheery quality of fords voice was beginning to grate on the barmans
ears  it sounded like someone relentlessly playing the kazoo during one of the
more sombre passages of a war requiem 
one of the bones in fords shoulder began to grate against another one of the
bones in his shoulder in a way which suggested that the hand had learnt the
principles of pain from a highly skilled chiropracter  luckily, the
shoulder it was holding was not the one he had his satchel slung over 
the barman slid the card back across the bar at ford  exactly how
serious, the american express company had got to know very rapidly, and
the increasingly strident and panic-stricken demands of its debt collection de-
partment were only silenced by the unexpected demolition of the entire planet
by the vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass  aaaargggh  
he glanced around at the motley collection of thugs, pimps and record com-
pany executives that skulked on the edges of the dim pools of light with which
the dark shadows of the bars inner recesses were pitted  they were all very de-
liberately looking in any direction but his now, carefully picking up the threads
of their former conversations about murders, drug rings and music publishing
deals  they knew what would happen now and didnt want to watch in case
it put them off their drinks 
you gonna die, boy, the barman murmured quietly at ford prefect, and the
evidence was on his side  the bar used to have one of those signs hanging up
which said, please dont ask for credit as a punch in the mouth often offends,
but in the interest of strict accuracy this was altered to, please dont ask for
credit because having your throat torn out by a savage bird while a disem-
bodied hand smashes your head against the bar often offends  however, this
made an unreadable mess of the notice, and anyway didnt have the same ring
to it, so it was taken down again  he picked it up and studied it
thoughtfully under the malevolent gaze of the barman, and the equally malev-
olent gaze of the bird, which was currently gouging great furrows in the bar
top with its talons  he had, after all, been in the bar all day, he had been
drinking a lot of stuff with bubbles in it, and he had bought an awful lot of
rounds for all the pimps, thugs and record executives who suddenly couldnt
remember who he was 

half-opened flap of his satchel 
you see, said the barman, and his face seemed to wobble evilly in front of
fords, i have a reputation to think of  you see that, dont you?
this is it, thought ford 
with a sudden flash of speed he opened his satchel and slapped down on the
bar top his copy of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy and the official
card which said that he was a field researcher for the guide and absolutely
not allowed to do what he was now doing 
want a write-up?
the barmans face stopped in mid-wobble 
that, said the barman in a barely audible whisper, from between dry lips,
will do nicely, sir 



indeed,

the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy is a powerful organ  so none of its field researchers are al-
lowed to accept any kind of services, discounts or preferential treatment of any
kind in return for editorial favours unless:
a) they have made a bona fide attempt to pay for a service in the normal way;
b) their lives would be otherwise in danger;
c) they really want to 
the air was stifling, but he liked it because it was stifling city air, full of
excitingly unpleasant smells, dangerous music and the sound of warring police
tribes 
he carried his satchel with an easy swaying motion so that he could get a good
swing at anybody who tried to take it from him without asking  it contained
everything he owned, which at the moment wasnt much 
a limousine careered down the street, dodging between the piles of burning
garbage, and frightening an old pack animal which lurched, screeching, out
of its way, stumbled against the window of a herbal remedies shop, set off a
wailing alarm, blundered off down the street, and then pretended to fall down
the steps of a small pasta restaurant where it knew it would get photographed
and fed 
as far as i can tell, said ford, im having one 
dont know, said the girl  maybe youll get rich  and whats that?
i tell them its ok to be rich 
gunfire erupted from a window high above them, but it was only a bass player
getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times in a row, and bass players
are two a penny in han dold city  she was tall,
and had that kind of self-possessed shyness which is a great trick if you can do
it 
goosnargh, said ford prefect, which was a special betelgeusian word he
used when he knew he should say something but didnt know what it should
be 
he sat on a step, took from his satchel a bottle of that ol janx spirit and a
towel  he opened the bottle and wiped the top of it with the towel, which had
the opposite effect to the one intended, in that the ol janx spirit instantly
killed off millions of the germs which had been slowly building up quite a com-
plex and enlightened civilization on the smellier patches of the towel 
want some? he said, after hed had a swig himself 
they sat for a while, peacefully listening to the clamour of burglar alarms in
the next block 
as it happens, im owed a lot of money, said ford, so if i ever get hold of
it, can i come and see you then maybe?
sure, ill be here, said the girl  once id got that the second one just came one afternoon after
lunch  cars with screaming sirens converged on the area, only to find
themselves being picked off by copters which came thudding through the air
between the citys mountainous tower blocks 
in fact, said ford, having to shout now above the din, it wasnt quite like
that 
he took his copy of the guide back out of his satchel  really worthwhile job, eh?
theyve still got to pay me, though 
its getting impossible to talk isnt it?
what?
she shrugged and pointed upwards 
there was a copter above them now which seemed to be involved in a side
skirmish with the band upstairs  smoke was billowing from the building  the
sound engineer was hanging out of the window by his fingertips, and a mad-
dened guitarist was beating on his fingers with a burning guitar  they ducked
into an alleyway etha
net  im a working girl, and
there are people over there who need me 
she brushed aside fords half-articulated protests, and left him sitting deject-
edly on his garbage can preparing to watch a large swathe of his working life
being swept away electronically into the ether  the police battle had moved
off to other sectors of the city, the few surviving members of the rock band
had agreed to recognize their musical differences and pursue solo careers, the
street theatre group were re-emerging from the pasta restaurant with the pack
animal, telling it they would take it to a bar they knew where it would be
treated with a little respect, and a little way further on the steel grey limou-
sine was parked silently by the kerbside 
behind her, in the darkness of the alley, a green flickering glow was bathing
ford prefects face, and his eyes were slowly widening in astonishment 
for where he had expected to find nothing, an erased, closed-off entry, there
was instead a continuous stream of data - text, diagrams, figures and im-
ages, moving descriptions of surf on australian beaches, yoghurt on greek
islands, restaurants to avoid in los angeles, currency deals to avoid in istan-
bul, weather to avoid in london, bars to go everywhere  dont
worry if you dont know how the machine works and you cant speak the lan-
guage, dont understand the geography or indeed the basic physics of the area,
and have large green antennae growing out of your head 
amphibious life forms from any of the worlds in the swulling, noxios or
nausalia systems will particularly enjoy the east river, which is said to be
richer in those lovely life-giving nutrients then the finest and most virulent
laboratory slime yet achieved  it is impossible to have more fun without
electrocuting your pleasure centres  
this was a planet he had seen completely destroyed, seen with his own two
eyes or rather, blinded as he had been by the hellish disruption of air and light,
felt with his own two feet as the ground had started to pound at him like a
hammer, bucking, roaring, gripped by tidal waves of energy pouring out of the
loathsome yellow vogon ships  and then at last, five seconds after the moment
he had determined as being the last possible moment had already passed, the
gently swinging nausea of dematerialization as he and arthur dent had been
beamed up through the atmosphere like a sports broadcast 
there was no mistake, there couldnt have been 
and yet here - he activated the guide again - was his own entry on how you
would set about having a good time in bournemouth, dorset, england, which
he had always prided himself on as being one of the most baroque pieces of
invention he had ever delivered 
he stashed the guide back in his satchel and hurried out on to the street again 
ford grinned, detoured round the next block which was now in flames, found
a police helicopter which was standing unattended in the street, broke into it,
strapped himself in, crossed his fingers and sent it hurtling inexpertly into the
sky 
he weaved terrifyingly up through the canyoned walls of the city, and once
clear of them, hurtled through the black and red pall of smoke which hung
permanently above it 
ten minutes later, with all the copters sirens blaring and its rapid-fire cannon
blasting at random into the clouds, ford prefect brought it careering down
among the gantries and landing lights at han dold spaceport, where it settled
like a gigantic, startled and very noisy gnat 
since he hadnt damaged it too much he was able to trade it in for a first class
ticket on the next ship leaving the system, and settled into one of its huge,
voluptuous body-hugging seats 
behind him in the backseat was a girl who had made him crack his head on the
door as he climbed in  he didnt know if it was just because she was the first
female of his own species that he had laid eyes on in years, or what it was, but
he felt stupefied with, with   you are not, he continued to himself in the firmest internal
voice he could muster, in a fit and rational state  relax, dont panic, concentrate on
breathing deeply 
are you sure shes all right? he said again 
beyond the fact that she was, to him, heartthumpingly beautiful, he could
make out very little, how tall she was, how old she was, the exact shading of
her hair 
shes just drugged, said her brother, shrugging, not moving his eyes from
the road ahead 
and thats all right, is it? said arthur, in alarm 
the conversation so far had been going astoundingly badly 
after an initial flurry of opening hellos, he and russell - the wonderful girls
brothers name was russell, a name which, to arthurs mind, always suggested
burly men with blond moustaches and blow-dried hair, who would at the slight-
est provocation start wearing velvet tuxedos and frilly shirtfronts and would
then have to be forcibly restrained from commentating on snooker matches -
had quickly discovered they didnt like each other at all  to be fair to him - though arthur didnt see any necessity for this

25

beyond the sheer mental exercise of it - he, arthur, was looking pretty grim
himself 
shes not a junkie, said russell suddenly, as if he clearly thought that some-
one else in the car might be  shes under sedation 
but thats terrible, said arthur, twisting round to look at her again  her
dark hair fell across her face, obscuring it 
whats the matter with her, is she ill?
no, said russell, merely barking mad  im taking her back to the hospital and telling
them to have another go  they let her out while she still thought she was a
hedgehog 
well, maybe not a hedgehog, he said after hed settled down again  if somebody thinks theyre
a hedgehog, presumably you just give em a mirror and a few pictures of hedge-
hogs and tell them to sort it out for themselves, come down again when they
feel better  at least medical science could deal with it, thats the point  seems
thats no good enough for fenny, though 
fenny   he was rather
disappointed to discover her name was fenny  it was a rather silly, dispiriting

chapter 5 

name, such as an unlovely maiden aunt might vote herself if she couldnt sus-
tain the name fenella properly 
not that i wasnt sympathetic, continued russell, but it did get a bit irri-
tating 
this is your turning isnt it?
ah, no, said arthur, five miles further on  if thats all right 
it was in fact arthurs turning, but he couldnt leave without finding out some-
thing more about this girl who seemed to have taken such a grip on his mind
without even waking up  familiar landmarks had been flitting by,
ghostlike, in the dark, giving rise to the shudders that only very very normal
things can create, when seen where the mind is unprepared for them, and in
an unfamiliar light 
eight years ago, at lunchtime, this planet had been demolished, utterly de-
stroyed, by the huge yellow vogon ships which had hung in the lunchtime sky
as if the law of gravity was no more than a local regulation, and breaking it
no more than a parking offence 
she says she suffers from strange delusions that shes living in the real world 
its no good telling her that she is living in the real world because she just says
thats why the delusions are so strange  dont know about you, but i find that
kind of conversation pretty exhausting  and the doctors going on about
strange jumps in her brainwave patterns 
jumps?
this, said fenny 
arthur whirled round in his seat and stared into her suddenly open but ut-

27

terly vacant eyes  whatever she was looking at wasnt in the car 
this what?
this what? how the heck should i know? this hedgehog, that chimney pot,
the other pair of don alfonsos tweezers  shes barking mad, i thought id
mentioned that 
you dont seem to care very much  arthur tried to say it as matter-of-factly
as possible but it didnt seem to work 
ok, im sorry  i didnt mean it to sound like that,
said arthur  youll have to excuse me  i just hitched
from the other side of the horsehead nebula 
he was astonished that of all the sensations fighting for room in his head on
this night as he returned to the home that he had thought had vanished into
oblivion for ever, the one that was compelling him was an obsession with this
bizarre girl of whom he knew nothing other than that she had said this to
him, and that he wouldnt wish her brother on a vogon 
look, this is my sister, i dont even know why im talking to you about  
ok, im sorry  perhaps youd better let me out 
russell swore and steered intently for a few seconds as the sky blattered at
them  he worked out his anger by rashly accelerating to pass a lorry marked
mckeenas all-weather haulage 
it started with all that business of the cia agent they found in the reservoir,
when everybody had all the hallucinations and everything, you remember?
arthur wondered for a moment whether to mention again that he had just
hitch-hiked back from the other side of the horsehead nebula and was for this
and various other related and astounding reasons a little out of touch with
recent events, but he decided it would only confuse matters further 

mansworth  dont know what she was doing there, but that was where she
cracked up  apparently she stood up, calmly announced that she had un-
dergone some extraordinary revelation or something, wobbled a bit, looked
confused, and finally collapsed screaming into an egg sandwich  im very sorry to hear that, he said a little stiffly 
russell made a sort of grumping noise 
so what, said arthur in an attempt to piece things together, was the cia
agent doing in the reservoir?
bobbing up and down of course  everyone said it
was a cock up, the cia trying experiments into drug warfare or something 
some crackpot theory that instead of invading a country it would be much
cheaper and more effective to make everyone think theyd been invaded 
what do you mean, what hallucinations? im talking about all that stuff
with the big yellow ships, everyone going crazy and saying were going to die,
and then pop, they vanished as the effect wore off  the cia denied it which
meant it must be true 
arthurs head went a little swimmy 
anyway, continued russell, whatever drug it was it didnt seem to wear off
so fast with fenny 
the vogon   you trying to say you dont remember any of this? where
have you been for heavens sake?
this was, to arthur, such an astonishingly good question that he half-leapt
out of his seat with shock 
christ!!! yelled russell, fighting to control the car which was suddenly try-
ing to skid  he pulled it out of the path of an oncoming lorry and swerved
up on to a grass bank  as the car lurched to a halt, the girl in the back was
thrown against russells seat and collapsed awkwardly 



from here it was a four-mile walk to his village: a further mile to the turning,
to which the abominable russell had now fiercely declined to take him, and
from there a further three miles of winding country lane 
the saab seethed off into the night 
he shook his head sharply in the hope that it might dislodge some salient fact
which would fall into place and make sense of an otherwise utterly bewildering
universe, but since the salient fact, if there was one, entirely failed to do this,
he set off up the road again, hoping that a good vigorous walk, and maybe
even some good painful blisters, would help to reassure him of his own exis-
tence at least, if not his sanity 30 when he arrived, a fact he discovered from the steamed and greasy
window of the horse and groom pub, in which there had hung for many years
a battered old guiness clock which featured a picture of an emu with a pint
glass jammed rather amusingly down its throat  no, damn it, had been demolished, because if
it hadnt then where the bloody heck had he been for the last eight years, and
how he had got there if not in one of the big yellow vogon ships which the
appalling russell had just been telling him were merely drug- induced hallu-
cinations, and yet if it had been demolished, what was he currently standing
on  ?
he jammed the brake on this line of thought because it wasnt going to get
him any further than it had the last twenty times hed been over it 
this was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime during which32

chapter 6 
it still didnt make sense 
pubs served drinks and he couldnt half do with one 
satisfied that his jumbled thought processes had at last arrived at a conclu-
sion, and a conclusion he was happy with, even if it wasnt the one he had set
out to achieve, he strode towards the door 
a small black wire-haired terrier ran out from behind a low wall and then,
catching sight of arthur, began to snarl  it belonged to an advertis-
ing friend of his, and was called know-nothing-bozo because the way its hair
stood up on its head it reminded people of the president of the united states,
and the dog knew arthur, or at least should do 
this prompted arthur to go and peer at the window again, this time with an
eye not for the asphyxiating emu but for himself 
he looked a lot like something a farmer would use to scare birds with, and there
was no doubt but that to go into the pub in his present condition would excite
comments of a raucous kind, and worse still, there would doubtless be several
people in there at the moment whom he knew, all of whom would be bound
to bombard him with questions which, at the moment, he felt ill-equipped to
deal with 
will smithers, for instance, the owner of know-nothing-bozo the non-wonder
dog, an animal so stupid that it had been sacked from one of wills own com-
mercials for being incapable of knowing which dog food it was supposed to
prefer, despite the fact that the meat in all the other bowls had had engine oil
poured over it  here was his dog, here was his car, a grey
porsche 928s with a sign in the back window which read, my other car is also
a porsche 
he stared at it and realized that he had just learned something he hadnt

33

known before 
was this really the earth? was there the slightest possibility that he had
made some extraordinary mistake?
the pub in front of him was unbearably familiar to him in every detail - every
brick, every piece of peeling paint; and inside he could sense its familiar stuffy,
noisy warmth, its exposed beams, its unauthentic cast-iron light fittings, its
bar sticky with beer that people he knew had put their elbows in, overlooked
by cardboard cutouts of girls with packets of peanuts stapled all over their
breasts 
hey, know-nothing!
the sound of will smithers voice meant he had to decide what do to quickly  it wasnt that arthur dis-
liked him as such - will was quite fun 
hey, know-nothing, whats up?
the door opened and will came out, wearing a leather flying jacket that hed
got a mate of his at the road research laboratory to crash a car into spe-
cially, in order to get that battered look 

mies!!!
the dog went berserk with barking, prancing up and down, yapping its little
heart out, beside itself in transports of ecstatic rage 
the door had to be forced open because of the astonishing accumulation of
junk mail on the doormat 
it jammed itself stuck on what he would later
discover were fourteen identical, personally addressed invitations to apply for
a credit card he already had, seventeen identical threatening letters for non-
payment of bills on a credit card he didnt have, thirty-three identical letters
saying that he personally had been specially selected as a man of taste and
discrimination who knew what he wanted and where he was going in todays
sophisticated jet- setting world and would he therefore like to buy some grotty
wallet, and also a dead tabby kitten 
he rammed himself through the relatively narrow opening afforded by all this,
stumbled through a pile of wine offers that no discriminating connoisseur would
want to miss, slithered over a heap of beach villa holidays, blundered up the
dark stairs to his bedroom and got to the phone just as it stopped ringing 
this appealed to arthurs sense of logic  since the electricity board cut him
off without fail every time he paid his bill, it seemed only reasonable that they36

chapter 7 

should leave him connected when he didnt  festeringly untidy, though the effect
was muted a little by a thick layer of dust  half-read books and magazines nes-
tled amongst piles of half-used towels  half pairs of socks reclined in half-drunk
cups of coffee  what was once a half-eaten sandwich had now half-turned into
something that arthur entirely didnt want to know about  bung a fork of
lightning through this lot, he thought to himself, and youd start the evolution
of life all over again 
for a moment or so he couldnt see what the one thing that was different was,
because it too was covered in a film of disgusting dust  the top of the box was a lid, with
a flap tucked into the body of the box 
he untucked it and looked into the box  it wasnt a proper globe because
it was open at the bottom, or, as arthur realized turning it over, at the top,
with a thick rim 
it was made of the most wonderful glass perfectly transparent, yet with an ex-
traordinary silver-grey quality as if crystal and slate had gone into its making 
he tapped it with his thumbnail and it rang with a deep and glorious chime
which was sustained for longer than seemed possible, and when at last it faded

37

seemed not to die away but to drift off into other worlds, as into a deep sea
dream 
entranced, arthur turned it round yet again, and this time the light from the
dusty little bedside lamp caught it at a different angle and glittered on some
fine abrasions on the fish bowls surface 
for fully five more minutes he turned the object round and around, held it to
the light at different angles, tapped it for its mesmerizing chime and pondered
on the meaning of the shadowy letters but could find none  he wouldnt be needing it any more, except for
watching foreign movies  the rain clouds themselves had now moved
on and were currently concentrating their attention on a small transport cafe
just outside bournemouth, but the sky through which they had passed had
been disturbed by them and now wore a damply ruffled air, as if it didnt
know what else it might not do it further provoked 
the wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse thats trying to decide
what sort of mood its in tonight, and a bell somewhere chimed midnight 
it was stiff and had to be jiggled and persuaded a little because the frame was
slightly rotten and the hinges had at some time in its life been rather sensibly
painted over, but eventually it was open  gone was the
ragged threadbare dressing gown, smeared with the mud of a hundred worlds,
stained with junk food condiment from a hundred grimy spaceports, gone was
the tangled mane of hair, gone the long and knotted beard, flourishing ecosys-
tem and all 
they were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at this partic-
ular scene, and the brain which interpreted the images the eyes resolved was
not the same brain 
he could feel like a tingle on distant nerve ends the flood of a far river, the
roll of invisible hills, the knot of heavy rainclouds parked somewhere away to
the south 
he could sense, too, the thrill of being a tree, which was something he hadnt
expected  he knew that it felt good to curl your toes in the earth, but hed
never realized it could feel quite as good as that  he could sense an almost un-
seemly wave of pleasure reaching out to him all the way from the new forest  he could go further and further back, but it got dull because
all it consisted of was sheep being startled by things theyd been startled by
the day before 
he left the sheep and let his mind drift outwards sleepily in developing ripples 
he passed it fleetingly and tried to feel for it again, but it eluded him like
the other card with an apple on it in pelmanism  he felt a spasm of excite-

39

ment because he knew instinctively who it was, or at least knew who it was he
wanted it to be, and once you know what it is you want to be true, instinct is
a very useful device for enabling you to know that it is 
he instinctively knew that it was fenny and that he wanted to find her; but
he could not 
again he couldnt find it  this time, whatever his instinct was busy telling
him it was all right to believe, he wasnt certain that it was fenny - or perhaps
it was a different fracture this time 
he let his mind sink slowly and widely into the earth, rippling, seeping, sink-
ing 
he was following the earth through its days, drifting with the rhythms of
its myriad pulses, seeping through the webs of its life, swelling with its tides,
turning with its weight 
he danced dizzily over the edge as the dreamland dropped sheer away beneath
him, a stupefying precipice into nothing, him wildly twisting, clawing at noth-
ing, flailing in horrifying space, spinning, falling 
across the jagged chasm had been another land, another time, an older world,
not fractured from, but hardly joined: two earths 
it was
silhouetted against the moonlight and he recognized its rather dull blockish
shape  his rose
bushes were carefully tended, pruned back for the winter, strapped to canes

40

chapter 7  he won-
dered what was holding him there, and when he discovered that nothing was
holding him there he crashed awkwardly to the ground 



arthur awoke feeling wonderful, absolutely fabulous, refreshed, overjoyed to
be home, bouncing with energy, hardly disappointed at all to discover it was
the middle of february 
between them they killed a virulent space disease hes picked up without know-
ing it in the flargathon gas swamps a few days earlier, which otherwise would
have killed off half the population of the western hemisphere, blinded the
other half and driven everyone else psychotic and sterile, so the earth was
lucky there 
just as he was finishing that, the phone went, but he let it ring while he main-
tained a moments respectful silence 
there had been a small number of significant letters in the piles of junk - some
documents from the council, dated three years earlier, relating to the proposed
demolition of his house, and some other letters about the setting up of a public
inquiry into the whole bypass scheme in the area; there was also an old letter
from greenpeace, the ecological pressure group to which he occasionally made
contributions, asking for help with their scheme to release dolphins and orcas
from captivity, and some postcards from friends, vaguely complaining that he
never got in touch these days 

he unpacked his towel and another few odd bits and pieces from the plastic
bag he had acquired at the port brasta mega-market  the slogan on the
side was a clever and elaborate pun in lingua centauri which was completely
incomprehensible in any other language and therefore entirely pointless for a
duty free shop at a spaceport 
he realized with a sudden twinge that something else must have dropped out
in the small spacecraft that had brought him to earth, kindly going out of its
way to drop him right beside the a303  he had lost his battered and spaceworn
copy of the thing which had helped him find his way across the unbelievable
wastes of space he had traversed  he had lost the hitch hikers guide to the
galaxy 
he phoned the bbc and asked to be put through to his department head  look, sorry i havent been in for six months
but ive gone mad  how soon can we expect you?
when do hedgehogs stop hibernating?
sometime in spring i think 
rightyho 
oh hello, is that the old elms hospital? yes, i was just phoning to see if i
could have a word with fenella, er   fenella - good lord, silly me, ill forget
my own name next, er, fenella - isnt this ridiculous? patient of yours, dark
haired girl, came in last night  
im afraid we dont have any patients called fenella 
oh, dont you? i mean fiona of course, we just call her fen  
im sorry, goodbye 
he had had the perfect idea for explaining away every inexplicable weirdness
about himself at a stroke, and he whistled to himself as he pushed open the
door which had so daunted him last night 

arthur!!!!
he grinned cheerfully at the boggling eyes that stared at him from all corners
of the pub, and told them all what a wonderful time hed had in southern
california 
of course, i had my own personal alchemist too  exuberance and hall and woodhouse
best bitter was a mixture to be wary of, but one of the first effects it had is
to stop you being wary of things, and the point at which arthur should have
stopped and explained no more was the point at which he started instead to
get inventive  its why ive lost so much
weight  the californians have rediscovered alchemy  in which
the ancients used to practise it  or at least, he added, failed to practise it 
they couldnt get it to work you know  couldnt
cut it 
i didnt think he was an alchemist, said another 
i thought, said a third, he was a seer 
he became a seer, said arthur to his audience, the component parts of which
were beginning to bob and blur a little, because he was such a lousy alchemist 
what has alchemy got to do, asked a bit of the audience, with losing46

chapter 9 

weight?
im glad you asked that, said arthur 
he paused and manoeuvred his thoughts  it was like watching oil tankers do-
ing three-point turns in the english channel 
theyve discovered how to turn excess body fat into gold, he said, in a sud-
den blur of coherence 
youre kidding 
you havent seen anything, insisted arthur  he composed
the next bit of his story in his mind, which was going to be something about
the tank needing to be orientated along a line dropped perpendicularly from
the pole star to a baseline drawn between mars and venus, and was about to
start trying to say it when he decided to give it a miss  he paused
for effect, subcoo   subyoo   subtoocay   - he paused for breath - sub-
cutaneous gold, which you can have surgically removed  he
paused again for a maths break, fifty-fifty with the alchemist  make a lot of
money!
he looked swayingly around at his audience, and could not help but be aware
of an air of scepticism about their jumbled faces  youve got to look as if youve seen the galaxy 
youve got to look as if youve seen life  thats what i got  i hope being thirty doesnt come back into fashion or
ive wasted a lot of money  im very happy to be home  really
mucks you up for a couple of days 
i dont think hes been there at all, muttered another  and whats happened to him 
after a little sleep arthur got up and pottered round the house a bit  he felt
woozy and a little low, still disoriented by the journey  he wondered how he
was going to find fenny  he tapped it again, and despite being
full of water and a small yellow babel fish which was gulping its way around
rather dejectedly, it still chimed its deep and resonant chime as clearly and
mesmerically as before 
ford prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction, realized that he had
no reason to suppress it, and laughed out loud, a wicked laugh 
he switched the incoming signal through from the sub-etha net to the ships
hi-fi system, and the odd, rather stilted, sing-song voice spoke out with re-
markable clarity round the cabin 
he tweaked the volume up just a little while keeping a careful eye on a rapidly
changing table of figures on the ships computer display 
he didnt want a murder on his conscience 
he checked out the packed cargo hold, and wasnt at all satisfied with the
sound  there was altogether too much crated junk in the way  he stepped50

chapter 10  he broke open a closed control panel
and pushed the jettison button  he didnt know why he hadnt thought of
that before  a whooshing rumbling noise died away quickly into silence 
he double-checked the computer display above the freezer bed, dimmed the
lights and checked it again 
he tiptoed out and returned to the control cabin 
he gazed out into the inky night  the star the size of a brilliant biscuit crumb
he could see in the distance was zondostina, or as it was known on the world
from which the rather stilted, sing-song voice was being received, pleiades
zeta 
the bright orange curve that filled over half the visible area was the giant gas
planet sesefras magna, where the xaxisian battleships docked, and just rising
over its horizon was a small cool blue moon, epun 
for twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the ship and epun
closed, as the ships computer teased and kneaded the numbers that would
bring it into a loop around the little moon, close the loop and keep it there,
orbiting in perpetual obscurity 
his original plan had been to close down all external signalling and radiation
from the ship, to render it as nearly invisible as possible unless you were ac-
tually looking at it, but then hed had an idea he preferred 
he didnt like to think of himself as the sort of person who giggled or snig-
gered, but he had to admit that he had been giggling and sniggering almost
continuously for well over half an hour now  he ran again the computer simulation of the launch-
ing of the ships little escape-o-buggy, balancing actions, reactions, tangential
forces, all the mathematical poetry of motion, and saw that it was good  he would have laughed out loud but he didnt have
the room  he wondered if he should get up and move to another table, but there
didnt seem to be one free in the whole cafeteria  a light, sunny spray of rain hung
over the motorway  two months hed been back now  slipping back into his
old life had in fact been laughably easy  now that the
earths atmosphere had closed over his head for good, he thought, wrongly,
everything within it gave him extraordinary pleasure  theyre
light and refreshing 
thats what they all say, he said, and glowered darkly from his corner seat 
he was a lorry driver  arthur knew this because his opening, unprovoked re-
mark had been, im a lorry driver  ironic isnt it?
bloody ironic 
if there was a sequitur hidden in this remark, arthur had not been able to
divine it and had merely given a little grunt, affable but not encouraging 
but the man had not been deterred then, and was not deterred now 

he leaned forward, screwing his face up as if he was going to say something
about the government  there was
even, he noticed, a faint rainbow glistening over the devon hills 
he climbed into his battered but adored old black golf gti, squealed the tyres,
and headed out past the islands of petrol pumps and on to the slip road back
towards the motorway 
he was wrong to think that it would ever be possible to put behind him the
tangled web of irresolutions into which his galactic travels had dragged him 
having narrowly avoided hitting her with the actual car, he hit her instead
with the car door as he leant across and flung it open at her 
it caught her hand and knocked away her umbrella, which then bowled wildly
away across the road 
shit! yelled arthur as helpfully as he cold, leapt out of his own door,
narrowly avoided being run down by mckeenas all- weather haulage, and
watched in horror as it ran down fennys umbrella instead  the lorry swept
along the motorway and away 
the umbrella lay like a recently swatted daddy-long-legs, expiring sadly on the
ground  there didnt seem to be a lot of point in offering the thing back
to her 
he looked at her and tailed off 
she was tallish with dark hair which fell in waves around a pale and serious
face  the effect was very disconcerting, and it discon-
certed arthur like hell 
she grinned, tossed her bag into the back and swivelled herself into the front
seat 
dont worry about the umbrella, she said to him as she climbed in  it was
my brothers and he cant have liked it or he wouldnt have given it to me 
she laughed and pulled on her seatbelt  youre not a friend of my brothers
are you?
no 
her voice was the only part of her which didnt say good 
he was meant to pick me up - my brother - but phoned to say he couldnt
make it 
perhaps we ought to first sort out, said arthur, looking back over his shoul-
der as he eased his car into the motorway traffic, where im taking you 
id like to go to taunton, she said, please  if thats all right 
you live in taunton? he said, hoping that hed managed to sound merely

56

chapter 11  taunton was wonderfully close to him  theres a train in just under an hour  taunton was only minutes away up the motor-
way 
bungling idiot  bungling idiot 
he couldnt believe it 
thirty seconds into the conversation, and already hed blown it 
taunton 5 miles, said the signpost 
you still havent told me how   he was thrashing about 
he wanted something along the lines of thy knotted and combined locks to
part, and each particular quill to stand on end like quills upon the fretful por-
pentine but didnt think he could carry it off and didnt like the hedgehog
reference  which would take more than five miles, he settled for in the end, rather
lamely he was afraid 
just supposing, he said, just supposing - he didnt know what was com-

57

ing next, so he thought hed just sit back and listen - that there was some
extraordinary way in which you were very important to me, and that, though
you didnt know it, i was very important to you, but it all went for nothing
because we only had five miles and i was a stupid idiot at knowing how to say
something very important to someone ive only just met and not crash into
lorries at the same time, what would you say  
shit!
he narrowly avoided careering into the side of a hundred italian washing ma-
chines in a german lorry 
it is by eating sandwiches in pubs on saturday lunchtimes that the british seek
to atone for whatever their national sins have been  theyre not altogether
clear what those sins are, and dont want to know either  but whatever their sins are they are
amply atoned for by the sandwiches they make themselves eat  joyless tubes, full of gristle, floating in a sea of something hot
and sad, stuck with a plastic pin in the shape of a chefs hat: a memorial, one
feels, for some chef who hated the world, and died, forgotten and alone among
his cats on a back stair in stepney  on it were some dirty glasses, and some
soggy beermats with jokes printed on them  arthur got fenny a tomato juice,
and himself a pint of yellow water with gas in it  he
didnt know why  he bought them for something to do while the gas settled60

chapter 12 
the barman dunked arthurs change in a pool of beer on the bar, for which
arthur thanked him 
she sounded, as well she might, extremely sceptical, and arthurs heart sank 
hardly, he felt, the most conductive setting to try to explain to her as she sat
there, suddenly cool and defensive, that in a sort of out-of-body dream he had
had a telepathic sense that the mental breakdown she had suffered had been
connected with the fact that, appearances to the contrary nonwithstanding,
the earth had been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass,
something which he alone on earth knew anything about, having virtually
witnessed it from a vogon spaceship, and that furthermore both his body and
soul ached for her unbearably and he needed to got to bed with her as soon
as was humanly possible 
i wonder if youd like to buy some tickets for our raffle? its just a little one 
to raise money for anjie whos retiring 
he was being leant over by a rather stiffly slim middle-aged woman with a
prim knitted suit and a prim little perm, and a prim little smile that probably
got licked by prim little dogs a lot 
she was holding out a small book of cloakroom tickets and a collecting tin 
only ten pence each, she said, so you could probably even buy two  with-
out breaking the bank! she gave a tinkly little laugh and then a curiously
long sigh  saying without breaking the bank had obviously given her more
pleasure than anything since some gis had been billeted on her in the war 
yes, thank you, said arthur, pocketing the tickets rather brusquely and
glancing at his watch 
he turned towards fenny 
so did the woman with the raffle tickets  its for anjies kidney ma-

61

chine  shes retiring you see 
er, look, here you are, said arthur, and pushed a fifty pence piece at her in
the hope that that would see her off 
oh, we are in the money, arent we? said the woman, with a long smiling
sigh  down from london are we?
no, thats all right, really, he said with a wave of his hand, and she started
with an awful deliberation to peel off five tickets, one by one  theyre very nice prizes, you know 
the woman turned to fenny once again 
oh, i see! how nice!
she smiled sickeningly at both of them  arthur turned des-
perately to fenny, and was relieved to see that she was rocking with silent
laughter 
hes the only one who calls me fenny, and im not fond of him for it 
so whats  ?
fenchurch 
what?
fenchurch 
fenchurch 
yes, she said, and im watching you like a lynx to see if youre going to ask
the same silly question that everybody asks me until i want to scream 
oh, he said, thats a little unfair, isnt it?
yes  better than have you call me fenny all the time 
weve only got two tickets left, you see, and since you were so generous when
i spoke to you before  
the woman with the perm and the smile and the now nearly empty book of
cloakroom tickets was now waving the two last ones under his nose 
i thought id give the opportunity to you, because the prizes are so nice  i know youll like them  and it is for anjies retirement present
you see 
he held out two more ten pence pieces to her, and took the tickets 
oh dear, she said, im not interrupting anything am i?
she peered anxiously at both of them 
i say, she said, in a delightful ecstacy of worry, youre not   we havent had a chance to talk yet 
he glanced at fenchurch 
we can do it together if you like, said fenchurch  at fenchurch street station, they finished  dont be silly 
well, i dont know, spluttered arthur, or rather  
it was in the ticket queue 
the ticket queue  they only
say you wouldnt believe how bored it is possible to get in the ticket queue at
fenchurch street station 
she sipped demurely at her tomato juice and looked at her watch 
im going to have to go in a minute or two, said fenchurch, and you havent
begun to tell me whatever this terrifically extraordinary thing is that you were
so keen to get off your chest 
why dont you let me drive you to london? said arthur  its saturday,
ive got nothing particular to do, id  
arthurs heart went boom boom churn churn as she scribbled seven figures in
pencil on a scrap of paper and handed it to him  i -
a box, said a trailing voice, of cherry liqueurs, and also, and i know youll
like this, a gramophone record of scottish bagpipe music  
i just thought id let you have a look at them, said the permed woman, as
youre down from london   he could see that they
were indeed a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and a record of bagpipe music 
ill let you have your drink in peace now, she said, patting arthur lightly on
his seething shoulder, but i knew youd like to see 
arthur re-engaged his eyes with fenchurchs once again, and suddenly was at

64

chapter 12 
dont worry, said fenchurch, looking at him steadily from over the top of
her glass, we will talk again 
perhaps, she added, it wouldnt have gone so well if it wasnt for her 



that night, at home, as he was prancing round the house pretending to be trip-
ping through cornfields in slow motion and continually exploding with sudden
laughter, arthur thought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe
music he had won  it was eight oclock and he decided he would make himself,
force himself, to listen to the whole record before he phoned her  he wanted her and didnt care who knew it 
he actually caught himself saying thinks like yippee as he prances ridicu-
lously round the house  he
giggled foolishly as he lowered the stylus on to the disc  the appallingly permed woman was waving66

chapter 13 
they hadnt listened to the bit about how pleased and happy anjie was going
to be about the 4 
fenchurch gave him a push  dont be bad tempered 
hello, yes? yes, thats right  youll ave to speak up, theres an awful
lot of noise in ere  its yvonne who does lunch, and jim,
hes the landlord  no, i wasnt on  what?
youll have to speak up 
what? no, dont know anything about no raffle  what?
no, dont know nothing about it 
the barmaid put her hand over the receiver and called over the noisy bar 
ere, jim, bloke on the phone says something about hes won a raffle  he
keeps on saying its ticket 37 and hes won 
no, there was a guy in the pub here won, shouted back the barman 
he says ave we got the ticket 
well how can he think hes won if he hasnt even got a ticket?
jim says ow can you think youve won if you avent even got the ticket 
jim, e keeps effing and blinding at me  says theres a number on the ticket 
course there was a number on the ticket, it was a bloody raffle ticket wasnt
it?
e says e means its a telephone number on the ticket  as the time
came for it not to happen, it duly didnt happen and so the afternoon wore
itself away and the sun dropped beneath the long line of sea, and the day was
gone 
the beach was a beach we shall not name, because his private house was
there, but it was a small sandy stretch somewhere along the hundreds of miles
of coastline that first runs west from los angeles, which is described in the
new edition of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy in one entry as junky,
wunky, lunky, stunky, and whats that other word, and all kinds of bad stuff,
woo, and in another, written only hours later as being like several thousand
square miles of american express junk mail, but without the same sense of
moral depth  until youve settled in
and got the hang of the place it is best to say no to three questions out of
any given four that anyone may ask you, because there are some very strange
things going on there, some of which an unsuspecting alien could die of  the
hundreds of curling miles of cliffs and sand, palm trees, breakers and sunsets
are described in the guide as boffo 
and somewhere on this good boffo stretch of coastline lay the house of this
inconsolable man, a man whom many regarded as being insane 

one of the many many reasons why people thought him insane was because of
the peculiarity of his house which, even in a land where most peoples houses
were peculiar in one way or another, was quite extreme in his peculiarness 
his name was simply john watson, though he preferred to be called - and
some of his friends had now reluctantly agreed to this - wonko the sane 



after a disgusting sunday spent emptying rubbish bins behind a pub in taunton,
and finding nothing, no raffle ticket, no telephone number, arthur tried ev-
erything he could to find fenchurch, and the more things he tried, the more
weeks passed 
he raged and railed against himself, against fate, against the world and its
weather  he even, in his sorrow and his fury, went and sat in the motorway
service station cafeteria where hed been just before he met her 
blatter 
what?
it will blatter  however, as if to bait him with the knowledge
that such coincidences could in fact happen, fate had chosen to reunite him
with the lorry driver he had encountered there last time 
the more he tried to ignore him, the more he found himself being dragged
back into the gravitic whirlpool of the mans exasperating conversation  thats what he should do 

it never stops raining! ranted the lorry driver  he thumped the table, spilt
his tea, and actually, for a moment, appeared to be steaming  the time, raved the man, thumping the table again, in time
to the words 
stupid? whys it stupid? whys it stupid to say it rains all the time if it
rains the whole time?
didnt rain yesterday 
did in darlington 
and it was pissing down there, i can tell you 
you dont want to sit there, mate, said a passing stranger in overalls to
arthur cheerily  thats thundercloud corner that is  theres one reserved in every
motorway caff between here and sunny denmark 
swhat we all do  hows it going, rob? keeping busy? got your wet-weather
tyres on? har har 
he breezed by and went to tell a joke about britt ekland to someone at a
nearby table 
see, none of them bastards take me seriously, said rob mckeena  but,
he added darkly, leaning forward and screwing up his eyes, they all know its
true!
arthur frowned 
like my wife, hissed the sole owner and driver of mckeenas all-weather
haulage  she says its nonsense and i make a fuss and complain about noth-
ing, but, he paused dramatically and darted out dangerous looks from his
eyes, she always brings the washing in when i phone to say im on me way
home! he brandished his coffee spoon  shows every single place ive ever been  and it was uniformly, he snarled, orrible 
well, said arthur, getting up to leave at last, perhaps youd better show it
to someone 
i will, said rob mckeena  arthur dent was such a person and
so he went to exeter to buy a computer  but he felt he ought
to have some serious purpose in mind before he simply went and lashed out a
lot of readies on what people might otherwise mistake as being just a thing to
play with 
have you much experience of computers?
arthur wondered whether to mention eddie the shipboard computer on the
heart of gold, who could have done the job in a second, or deep thought, or
- but decided he wouldnt  over a few days he also acquired some
astronomical software, plotted the movements of stars, drew rough little dia-
grams of how he seemed to remember the stars to have been in the sky when76

chapter 17  he didnt even know how long it
had been, beyond ford prefects rough guess at the time that it was a couple
of million years and he simply didnt have the maths 
he decided not to mind the fact that with the extraordinary jumble of rules
of thumb, wild approximations and arcane guesswork he was using he would
be lucky to hit the right galaxy, he just went ahead and got a result 
you can only come in for a few minutes, said fenchurch  im just going
out 
fenchurch was unavoidably busy for the afternoon, so arthur wandered in a
blissed-out haze and looked at all the shops which, in islington, are quite an
useful bunch, as anyone who regularly needs old woodworking tools, boer war
helmets, drag, office furniture or fish will readily confirm 
the sun beat down over the roofgardens  it beat on architects and plumbers 
it beat on barristers and burglars  it beat on pizzas  theres a cellar
with a secret passage which connects with a nearby pub  it was built for the
prince regent apparently, so he could make his escape when he needed to 
youll have to excuse me, said arthur  im terribly happy 
he wandered hazily on and found himself outside the offices of greenpeace 
he remembered the contents of his file marked things to do - urgent!, which
he hadnt opened again in the meantime  he marched in with a cheery smile
and said hed come to give them some money to help free the dolphins 
this wasnt quite the response he had expected, so he tried again 
just after six he returned to fenchurchs house in the alleyway, clutching a
bottle of champagne 
the house was a small converted stable in a light industrial alleyway behind
the derelict royal agricultural hall of islington  as well as its large stable
doors it also had a normal-looking front door of smartly glazed panelled wood
with a black dolphin door knocker 
an old pulley jutted out of the brickwork above the doorway and it was over
this that the rope arthur was holding was slung  the other end of the rope
held a suspended cello 
ok, said fenchurch, pull on the rope, steady the cello 
he pulled on the rope, he steadied the cello 
i cant pull on the rope again, he said, without letting go of the cello 
fenchurch leant down 
im steadying the cello, she said 
the cello eased up level with the doorway, swinging slightly, and fenchurch
manoeuvred it inside  a large old cast-iron mangle stood there, a surprising number of
kitchen sinks were piled in a corner  there was also, arthur was momentarily
alarmed to see, a pram, but it was very old and uncomplicatedly full of books 
the floor was old stained concrete, excitingly cracked  and this was the mea-
sure of arthurs mood as he stared up the rickety wooden steps in the far
corner 
an architect friend of mine keeps on telling me how he can do wonderful
things with this place, said fenchurch chattily as arthur emerged through
the floor  he keeps on coming round, standing in stunned amazement mut-
tering about space and objects and events and marvellous qualities of light,
then says he needs a pencil and disappears for weeks 
in fact, thought arthur as he looked about, the upper room was at least rea-
sonably wonderful anyway 
it was simply decorated, furnished with things

79

made out of cushions and also a stereo set with speakers which would have
impressed the guys who put up stonehenge 
there was a sort of gallery structure in the roof space which held a bed and
also a bathroom which, fenchurch explained, you could actually swing a cat
in  but, she added, only if it was a reasonably patient cat and didnt mind
a few nasty cracks about the head 
for arthur, who could usually contrive to feel self-conscious if left alone for
long enough with a swiss cheese plant, the moment was one of sustained reve-
lation  he felt on the sudden like a cramped and zoo-born animal who awakes
one morning to find the door to his cage hanging quietly open and the savan-
nah stretching grey and pink to the distant rising sun, while all around new
sounds are waking 
he hadnt realized that life speaks with a voice to you, a voice that brings
you answers to the questions you continually ask of it, had never consciously
detected it or recognized its tones till it now said something it had never said
to him before, which was yes 
fenchurch dropped her eyes away at last, with a tiny shake of her head  i shall have to remember, she added, that you are the
sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece of paper for two minutes
without winning a raffle with it 
she was dressed in a rather severe dark dress, not a particularly shapely one,
and it didnt really suit her 
i wear it specially for my cello teacher, she said  hes a nice boy, but
i sometimes think all that bowing gets him a bit excited 
she ran lightly up the steps to the gallery above, and called down, put the
bottle in the fridge for later  he told himself very
firmly that for this moment at least he would keep his eyes very firmly and
steadfastly locked on to the spines of her records, read the titles, nod appre-
ciatively, count the blasted things if he had to 
she was staring down at him with such intensity that she seemed hardly to no-
tice that he was looking up at her  then suddenly she shook her head, dropped
the light sundress over herself and disappeared quickly into the bathroom 
she emerged a moment later, all smiles and with a sunhat and came tripping
down the steps with extraordinary lightness 
hmmmm, she said, as if he hadnt really answered her question  arthurs eyes followed hers around, and while he was
looking in the other direction she slipped something out of a drawer and into
the canvas bag she was carrying 
ready?
did you know, she said with a slightly puzzled smile, that theres some-
thing wrong with me?
her directness caught arthur unprepared 
well, he said, id heard some vague sort of   i you heard it from
where i think you heard then thats not it 
a pang of worry went through arthur  can you tell me?
dont worry, she said, its nothing bad at all 
she touched his hand, and then leant forward and kissed him briefly 
arthur felt that if someone tapped him at that point he would have chimed,
like the deep sustained rolling chime his grey fishbowl made when he flicked
it with his thumbnail 



ford prefect was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire 
they were claustrophobic and ill-lit, and what light there was was continually
flickering and dimming as power surged this way and that through the ship,
causing heavy vibrations and rasping humming noises 
that wasnt it, though 
he paused and leaned back against the wall as something that looked like a
small silver power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty sear-
ing screech 
that wasnt it either  a
small platoon of robots weent by making a terrible clattering 
he passed a series of observation monitors let into the walls behind plates of
toughened but still badly scratched perspex 
one of them showed some horrible green scaly reptilian figure ranting and
raving about the single transferable vote system 
that wasnt it, though  it was showing a commercial for some brand of84

chapter 19  there was
nasty blaring music with it too, but that wasnt it 
he came upon another, much larger three-dimensional screen that was moni-
toring the outside of the vast silver xaxisian ship 
as he watched, a thousand horribly beweaponed zirzla robot starcruisers came
searing round the dark shadow of a moon, silhouetted against the blinding
disc of the star xaxis, and the ship simultaneously unleashed a vicious blaze
of hideously incomprehensible forces from all its orifices against them 
he yawned and dug his copy of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy out of
his satchel  he found rest
and recuperation and was about to pass on when he suddenly had a better
idea 
he looked back down at the guide again and flipped through a few likely lo-
cations  he suddenly laughed, and then rummaged in his satchel again 
when all the information that he could think was relevant had been dumped
into the module, he unplugged it again, tossed it lightly in the palm of his
hand, put the guide away in his satchel, smirked, and went in search of the
ships computer data banks 



the purpose of having the sun go low in the evenings, in the summer, espe-
cially in parks, said the voice earnestly, is to make girls breasts bob up and
down more clearly to the eye 
arthur and fenchurch giggled about this to each other as they passed 
and i am certain, said the frizzy ginger-haired youth with the long thin
nose who was epostulating from his deckchair by the side of the serpentine,
that if one worked the argument through, one would find that it flowed with
perfect naturalness and logic from everything, he insisted to his thin dark-
haired companion who was slumped in the next door deckchair feeling dejected
about his spots, that darwin was going on about  this is
indisputable 
he turned sharply and squinted through his spectacles at fenchurch  theres something wrong
with your left elbow  youre on completely the wrong
track 
the summer sun was sinking through the tress in the park, looking as if -
lets not mince words  everything about it is stun-
ning except for the rubbish on monday mornings  arthur and fenchurch found a man in shorts practising the bagpipes
to himself under a tree  the piper paused to chase off an american couple86

chapter 20 

who had tried, timidly to put some coins on the box his bagpipes came in 
no! he shouted at them, go away! im only practising 
he started resolutely to reinflate his bag, but even the noise this made could
not disfigure their mood 
arthur put his arms around her and moved them slowly downwards 
i dont think it can be your bottom, he said after a while, there doesnt
seem to be anything wrong with that at all 
yes, she agreed, theres absolutely nothing wrong with my bottom 
they kissed for so long that eventually the piper went and practised on the
other side of the tree 
a story, said fenchurch, cuddling his arm to her 
you know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to be some-
thing that happened to their wifes cousins best friend, but actually probably
got made up somewhere along the line 
like the raffle ticket 
tell me the story, said fenchurch firmly  hadnt occurred to me
before  fenchurch laughed 
so i bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get

id got the time of the train wrong  did you solve it?
what?
the crossword in the guardian 
i havent had a chance to look at it yet, said arthur, im still trying to buy
the coffee 
im buying it 
and dont ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and
i cant remember 
what you dont see, said arthur, because i havent mentioned him yet, is
the guy sitting at the table already 
whats he like?
perfectly ordinary  he didnt look, said arthur,
as if he was about to do anything weird 
fenchurch looked at him in astonishment 
what? why?
well, its not the sort of thing youre trained for is it? i searched my soul, and

88

chapter 20  fenchurch thought about it  i must say im not sure
what i would have done either  couldnt do a single clue,
took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it 
but youre fighting back, taking a tough line  honestly, insisted arthur, this is exactly what hap-
pened 
fenchurch stirred uncomfortably  i couldnt help noticing, er
  doesnt work  no, i ignored it with, if anything, even more vigour than
previously 
stared at the crossword, again, still couldnt budge a bit of it, so showing
some of the spirit that henry v did on st crispins day   gladiators could hardly have had a tougher
time 

89

gladiators, said fenchurch, would have had to do it in the sun  more phys-
ically gruelling 
what? said fenchurch 
you completely nitwit, she hooted, you almost completely and utterly fool-
ish person  these sort of stories always start like this,
dont they, when i was a kid   this is the bit where the girl
suddenly says, when i was a kid and starts to unburden herself  youre getting the bedroom interest in nice
and early 
it was one of those pictures that children are supposed to like, she said, but
dont  rabbits in waistcoats 
there may even have been a reindeer 
among the rabbits in waistcoats and the owls and the reindeer  a boy of the cheery gypsy ragamuffin variety  there was an otter swimming in front of
the raft, and i used to lie awake at night worrying about this otter having to
pull the raft, with all these wretched animals on it who shouldnt even be on
a raft, and the otter had such a thin tail to pull it with i thought it must hurt
pulling it all the time 
then one day - and remember id been looking at this picture every night for
years - i suddenly noticed that the raft had a sail 
fenchurch laughed and hugged her legs  the sudden shift of perspec-
tive that says put away your worries, the world is a good and perfect place  you probably thing im saying that because im going
to say that i felt like that this afternoon or something, dont you?
well, i   thats exactly what i felt  but you see,
ive felt that before, even stronger  im afraid im a bit of
a one, she said gazing off into the distance, for sudden startling revelations 
arthur was at sea, could hardly speak, and felt it wiser, therefore, for the mo-
ment not to try  no, it wasnt like that in fact,
it was more as if i was being connected into something, bit by bit 
does the number, said arthur gently, forty-two mean anything to you at
all?
what? no, what are you talking about? exclaimed fenchurch  its just the universe im never
quite sure about  dont worry if it sounds odd  and i dont mean biscuits 
arthur, you see, she said, thats what i no longer know  if i try to think back to it, it all goes flickery and jumpy, and if i
try too hard, i get as far as the teacup and i just black out  i just sat up and thought, oh! oh, well thats all right
then  yes, she added thoughtfully, im sure i did  how much sense am i
making?
it was fine up to the bit about the teacup 
well thats it, she said  fine up to the bit about the teacup ?
i know it sounds crazy, and everybody says it was hallucinations, but if that
was hallucinations then i have hallucinations in big screen 3d with 16-track
dolby stereo and should probably hire myself out to people who are bored
with shark movies  i suppose ive been in and out ever since 

thats why i have an instinctive nervousness, she said, of sudden startling
revelations thats everythings going to be all right  but now it seemed to go swimmy around him,
as it had that night in the car when fenchurchs brother had told him the silly
stories about the cia agent in the reservoir  the trees went swimmy 
anyway, said fenchurch, suddenly and brightly and with a wide- eyed smile,
there is something wrong with part of me, and youve got to find out what
it is 
whats the matter? she said 
arthur had shaken his head, not to disagree with her suggestion which he
thought was a truly excellent one, one of the worlds great suggestions, but
because he was just for a moment trying to free himself of the recurring im-
pression he had that just when he was least expecting it the universe would
suddenly leap out from behind a door and go boo at him 
im just trying to get this entirely clear in my mind, said arthur, you say
you felt as if the earth actually  
which is what everybody else says, he said hesitantly, is hallucinations?
yes, but arthur thats ridiculous  its just a word, it doesnt explain
anything  it doesnt explain why the dolphins disappeared 
doesnt explain the dolphins disappearing  which dolphins do you mean?
what do you mean which dolphins? im talking about when all the dolphins
disappeared 
the dolphins? youre saying the dolphins all disappeared? is this, said
arthur, trying to be absolutely clear on this point, what youre saying?
arthur where have you been for heavens sake? the dolphins all disappeared
on the same day i   thats what vanished means  i was thinking of going to see him because it seems the
only lead ive got on what happened to me 
i really would like to know where youve been, she said  and thats why we recognized each
other 
well, she said, now youve got someone you can tell 
fenchurch leaned across him and drew over her canvas bag  the thing she took out of her bag was
battered and travelworn as it had been hurled into prehistoric rivers, baked
under the sun that shines so redly on the deserts of kakrafoon, half-buried
in the marbled sands that fringe the heady vapoured oceans of santraginus
v, frozen on the glaciers of the moon of jaglan beta, sat on, kicked around
spaceships, scuffed and generally abused, and since its makers had thought
that these were exactly the sorts of things that might happen to it, they had
thoughtfully encased it in a sturdy plastic cover and written on it, in large
friendly letters, the words dont panic 

in russells car that night  have you been to many of these places?
arthur drew the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy from its cover  it was an act of great gen-
erosity on his part not to say, you dont want to, do you? which expects it  because i dont think, she added, standing up and looking
round the increasing gloom of the park, that it came from here 
im not even sure, she further added, slipping her arm around arthurs waist,
that i know where here is 



the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy is, as has been remarked before often
and accurately, a pretty startling kind of a thing 
read it through again and youll get it  a bit of a night-
mare, you might think, for a scrupulous and conscientious editor diligently
striving to keep this massively detailed and complex electronic tome abreast
of all the changing circumstances and conditions that the galaxy throws up
every minute of every hour of every day, and you would be wrong  where you
would be wrong would be in failing to realize that the editor, like all the edi-
tors of the guide has ever had, has no real grasp of the meanings of the words
scrupulous, conscientious or diligent, and tends to get his nightmares
through a straw 
take for example, the case of brequinda on the foth of avalars, famed in myth,
legend and stultifyingly dull tri-d mini-serieses as home of the magnificent and
magical fuolornis fire dragon 
in ancient days, when fragilis sang and saxaquine of the quenelux held sway,
when the air was sweet and the nights fragrant, but everyone somehow man-
aged to be, or so they claimed, though how on earth they could have thought96

chapter 21 

that anyone was even remotely likely to believe such a preposterous claim what
with all the sweet air and fragrant nights and whatnot is anyones guess, vir-
gins, it was not possible to heave a brick on brequinda in the foth of avalars
without hitting at least half a dozen fuolornis fire dragons 
not that fire dragons werent an essentially peace-loving species, because they
were  they adored it to bits, and this wholesale adoring of things to bits was
often in itself the problem: one so often hurts the one one loves, especially if
one is a fuolornis fire dragon with breath like a rocket booster and teeth like
a park fence  add
to all that the relatively small number of madmen who actually went around
the place heaving bricks, and you end up with a lot of people on brequinda in
the foth of avalars getting seriously hurt by dragons 
the fuolornis fire dragons were revered throughout the lands of brequinda
in the foth of valors for their savage beauty, their noble ways and their habit
of biting people who didnt revere them 
there is, for some unfathomed reason, something almost unbearably sexy
about having huge fire-breathing magical dragons flying low about the sky
on moonlit nights which were already dangerously on the sweet and fragrant
side 
why this should be so, the romance-besotted people of brequinda in the foth
of avalars could not have told you, and would not have stopped to discuss
the matter once the effect was up and going, for no sooner would a flock of
half a dozen silk-winged leather-bodied fuolornis fire dragons heave into sight
across the evening horizon than half the people of brequinda are scurrying off
into the woods with the other half, there to spend a busy breathless night
together and emerge with the first rays of dawn all smiling and happy and still
claiming, rather endearingly, to be virgins, if rather flushed and sticky virgins 
not surprisingly, the guides graphically enticing description of the general
state of affairs on this planet has proved to be astonishingly popular amongst

hitch-hikers who allow themselves to be guided by it, and so it has simply
never been taken out, and it is therefore left to latter-day travellers to find out
for themselves that todays modern brequinda in the city state of avalars is
now little more than concrete, strip joints and dragon burger bars 



the night in islington was sweet and fragrant 
there were, of course, no fuolornis fire dragons about in the alley, but if any
had chanced by they might just as well have sloped off across the road for a
pizza, for they were not going to be needed 
had an emergency cropped up while they were still in the middle of their
american hots with extra anchovy they could always have sent across a mes-
sage to put dire straits on the stereo, which is now known to have much the
same effect  fenchurch pushed ajar the upstairs
front door to let in a little more of the sweet fragrant night air 
no, said fenchurch, not till youve found out whats wrong with me, which
bit 
mark knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a schecter custom stra-
tocaster hoot and sing like angels on a saturday night, exhausted from being
good all week and needing a stiff beer - which is not strictly relevant at this
point since the record hadnt yet got to that bit, but there will be too much
else going on when it does, and furthermore the chronicler does not intend to
sit here with a track list and a stopwatch, so it seems best to mention it now
while things are still moving slowly 
she smiled in the dim light, and wriggled her shoulders noncommittally against
the cushions  since there are cushions in the universe, on squornshellous beta
to be exact, two worlds in from the swampland of the mattresses, that actively
enjoy being wriggled against, particularly if its noncommittally because of the
syncopated way in which the shoulders move, its a pity they werent there 
i have to admit, he said, that i really dont know what im looking for 
youll know when you find it, she said 
no, dont stop, she said, but its not that one now 
dont stop 
he stroked her right foot, ran his fingers around her ankle, under her toes,
along her instep and said, you mean its something to do with which leg im
holding  ?
she did another of the shrugs which would have brought such joy into the life
of a simple cushion from squornshellous beta 
well?
she looked at him almost challengingly 
so whats wrong with my feet? she said 
yes, he said, i see whats wrong with your feet  they dont touch the
ground ? she shook the hair forwards
over her eyes that were filling with dark fearful tears 



the battle raged on about the star of xaxis  hundreds of the fierce and hor-
ribly beweaponed zirzla ships had now been smashed and wrenched to atoms
by the withering forces the huge silver xaxisian ship was able to deploy 
part of the moon had gone too, blasted away by those same blazing forceguns
that ripped the very fabric of space as they passed through it 
the zirzla ships that remained, horribly beweaponed though they were, were
now hopelessly outclassed by the devastating power of the xaxisian ship, and
were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly disintegrating moon, when the xax-
isian ship, in hurtling pursuit behind them, suddenly announced that it needed
a holiday and left the field of battle 
with the stupendous powers at its command it flitted across vast tracts of ir-
rationally shaped space, quickly, effortlessly, and above all, quietly 
deep in his greasy, smelly bunk, fashioned out of a maintenance hatchway,
ford prefect slept among his towels, dreaming of old haunts  he dreamed at
one point in his slumbers of new york 
in his dream he was walking late at night along the east side, beside the
river which had become so extravagantly polluted that new lifeforms were now
emerging from it spontaneously, demanding welfare and voting rights 
hi, it said, ive just been created  im completely new to the universe in
all respects 
am i?
youre pretty direct, arent you?
no point in mucking about  are there and like you down there?
search me, buster, said the creature, as i said, im new here  whats it like?
here was something that ford felt he could speak about with authority 
er, how so?
well, its sort of orangey-yellow and dimpled on the outside, wet and squidgy
in the middle  its got pips inside, too 
deep in his bunk, ford prefect wriggled and turned on to his other side 
it wasnt his favourite type of dream because it didnt have eccentrica gal-
lumbits, the triple-breasted whore of eroticon vi in it, whom many of his
dreams did feature 



luckily there was a strong updraft in the alley because arthur hadnt done
this sort of thing for a while, at least, not deliberately, and deliberately is
exactly the way you are not meant to do it 
he swung down sharply, nearly catching himself a nasty crack on the jaw with
the doorstep and tumbled through the air, so suddenly stunned with what a
profoundly stupid thing he had just done that he completely forgot the bit
about hitting the ground and didnt 
the ground was hanging menacingly above his head  he tried to think nice thoughts about lemurs instead,
which was exactly the right thing to do because he couldnt at that moment
remember precisely what a lemur was, if it was one of those things that sweep
in great majestic herds across the plains of wherever it was or if that was wilde-
beests, so it was a tricky kind of thing to think nice thoughts about without
simply resorting to an icky sort of general well-disposedness towards things,
and all this kept his mind well occupied while his body tried to adjust to the
fact that it wasnt touching anything 
a mars bar wrapper fluttered down the alleyway 
the ground was still hanging menacingly above his head, and he thought it
was probably time to do something about that, such as fall away from it, which
is what he did 
he could feel the air clear about him now, breezing around him quite cheer-
fully, untroubled by his being there, and slowly, very, very slowly, as from a
deep and distant sleep, he opened his eyes 
he had flown before, of course, flown many times on krikkit until all the
birdtalk had driven him scatty, but this was different 
here he was on his own world, quietly, and without fuss, beyond a slight trem-
bling which could have been attributable to a number of things, being in the
air 
ten or fifteen feet below him was the hard tarmac and a few yards off to the
right the yellow street lights of upper street 
luckily the alleyway was dark since the light which was supposed to see it
through the night was on an ingenious timeswitch which meant it came on
just before lunchtime and went off again as the evening was beginning to draw
in 
i was about to ask you, she said in a low trembly voice, what you were
doing 
its quite easy, urged arthur, if you dont know how  thats the important
bit  be not at all sure how youre doing it 
just to demonstrate how easy it was he floated away down the alley, fell up-
wards quite dramatically and bobbed back down to her like a banknote on a
breath of wind ?

107

arthur bobbed down a little lower and held out his hand 
nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if - she stopped telling her-
self what what she was doing was like because she had a feeling she didnt
altogether want to know 
she fixed her eyes very very firmly on the guttering of the roof of the decrepit
warehouse opposite which had been annoying her for weeks because it was
clearly going to fall off and she wondered if anyone was going to do anything
about it or whether she ought to say something to somebody, and didnt think
for a moment about the fact that she was standing on the hands of someone
who wasnt standing on anything at all 
she hadnt seen the guttering from quite this angle before, and it looked to her
now as if as well as the mud and gunge up there there might also be a birds
nest  he particularly didnt want to get involved in an argument at the
moment and hoped that the guy would do it quietly and not look up 
he had the quiet shifty look of someone who habitually stole bicycles in alleys
and habitually didnt expect to find their owners hovering several feet above
them 

purpose and concentration, and when he found that the bike was unarguably
bound by hoops of tungsten carbide to an iron bar embedded in concrete, he
peacefully bent both its wheels and went on his way 
see what a piece of eggshell i have found you, said fenchurch in his ear  and so he whiled the night away,
sleeping 
its guff  it doesnt advance the action  it makes for nice fat books such as the
american market thrives on, but it doesnt actually get you anywhere 

but there are other omissions as well, beside the teethcleaning and trying to
find fresh socks variety, and in some of these people have often seemed inordi-
nately interested 
and what, they say, was he up to all those nights on the planet krikkit? just
because the planet didnt have fuolornis fire dragons or dire straits doesnt
mean that everyone just sat up every night reading 
or to take a more specific example, what about the night after the committee
meeting party on prehistoric earth, when arthur found himself sitting on a
hillside watching the moon rise over the softly burning trees in company with
a beautiful young girl called mella, recently escaped from a lifetime of staring
every morning at a hundred nearly identical photographs of moodily lit tubes
of toothpaste in the art department of an advertising agency on the planet
golgafrincham 
the next one didnt resume the story till five years later, and you can, claim
some, take discretion too far  this arthur dent, comes the cry from the
furthest reaches of the galaxy, and has even now been found inscribed on a
mysterious deep space probe thought to originate from an alien galaxy at a
distance too hideous to contemplate, what is he, man or mouse? is he inter-
ested in nothing more than tea and the wider issues of life? has he no spirit?
has he no passion? does he not, to put it in a nutshell, fuck?
those who wish to know should read on 
they drifted up, spiralling slowly around each other, like sycamore seeds falling
from sycamore trees in the autumn, except going the other way 
physics shook its head and, looking the other way, concentrated on keeping
the cars going along the euston road and out towards the westway flyover,
on keeping the streetlights lit and on making sure that when somebody on
baker street dropped a cheeseburger it went splat upon the ground 
dwindling headily beneath them, the beaded strings of light of london - lon-
don, arthur had to keep reminding himself, not the strangely coloured fields
of krikkit on the remote fringes of the galaxy, lighted freckles of which faintly
spanned the opening sky above them, but london - swayed, swaying and turn-
ing, turned 
try a swoop, he called to fenchurch 112

chapter 26 
they plummeted because this was london and you really couldnt do this sort
of thing here 
he couldnt catch her because this was london, and not a million miles from
here, seven hundred and fifty-six, to be exact, in pisa, galileo had clearly
demonstrated that two falling bodies fell at exactly the same rate of accelera-
tion irrespective of their relative weights 
arthur realized as he fell, giddily and sickeningly, that if he was going to hang
around in the sky believing everything that the italians had to say about
physics when they couldnt even keep a simple tower straight, that they were
in dead trouble, and damn well did fall faster than fenchurch  they were now falling together, which was all very sweet and romantic,
but didnt solve the basic problem, which was that they were falling, and the
ground wasnt waiting around to see if he had any more clever tricks up his
sleeve, but was coming up to meet them like an express train 
he couldnt support her weight, he hadnt anything he could support it with
or against 
fenchurch tried some little swoops, daringly, and found that if she judged
herself just right against a body of wind she could pull off some really quite
dazzling ones with a little pirouette at the end, followed by a little drop which
made her dress billow around her, and this is where readers who are keen to
know what marvin and ford prefect have been up to all this while should look
ahead to later chapters, because arthur now could wait no longer and helped
her take it off 
in a mute embrace, they drifted up till they were swimming amongst the misty
wraiths of moisture that you can see feathering around the wings of an aero-
plane but never feel because you are sitting warm inside the stuffy aeroplane
and looking through the little scratchy perspex window while somebody elses
son tries patiently to pour warm milk into your shirt 
arthur and fenchurch could feel them, wispy cold and thin, wreathing round
their bodies, very cold, very thin 
the two fragments from marks and spencer which, as fenchurch rose now
into the misty body of the clouds, arthur removed very, very slowly, which is
the only way its possible to do it when youre flying and also not using your
hands, went on to create considerable havoc in the morning in, respectively,
counting from top to bottom, isleworth and richmond 
they were in the cloud for a long time, because it was stacked very high, and
when finally they emerged wetly above it, fenchurch slowly spinning like a
starfish lapped by a rising tidepool, they found that above the clouds is where
the night get seriously moonlit 
they had emerged at the top of the high-stacked cumulo-nimbus, and now be-
gan lazily to drift down its contours, as fenchurch eased arthur in turn from
his clothes, prised him free of them till all were gone, winding their surprised
way down into the enveloping whiteness 
she kissed him, kissed his neck, his chest, and soon they were drifting on,
turning slowly, in a kind of speechless t-shape, which might have caused even
a fuolornis fire dragon, had one flown past, replete with pizza, to flap its
wings and cough a little 
there were, however, no fuolornis fire dragons in the clouds nor could there
be for, like the dinosaurs, the dodos, and the greater drubbered wintwock of
stegbartle major in the constellation fraz, and unlike the boeing 747 which is
in plentiful supply, they are sadly extinct, and the universe shall never know
their like again 
the reason that a boeing 747 crops up rather unexpectedly in the above list
is not unconnected with the fact that something very similar happened in the
lives of arthur and fenchurch a moment or two later 

they are big things, terrifyingly big  there is a thunderous attack of air, a moving wall of screaming wind, and
you get tossed aside, if you are foolish enough to be doing anything remotely
like what arthur and fenchurch were doing in its close vicinity, like butterflies
in the blitz 
this time, however, there was a heart-sickening fall or loss of nerve, a re-
grouping moments later and a wonderful new idea enthusiastically signalled
through the buffeting noise  kapelsen of boston, massachusetts was an elderly lady, indeed, she
felt her life was nearly at an end 
the following morning arthur and fenchurch slept very late in the alley de-
spite the continual wail of furniture being restored 
the following night they did it all over again, only this time with sony walk-
men 



this is all very wonderful, said fenchurch a few days later  you see, theres this difference between
us 
murray bost henson was a journalist on one of the papers with small pages
and big print  someone told me youd gone off into space or something  the bits which did mean
anything were often so wonderfully buried that no one could ever spot them
slipping past in the avalance of nonsense 
just a rumour my old elephant tusk, my little green baize card table, just a
rumour 
we thrive on it, my old prosthetic limb, we thrive on it  plus it would fit like
a whatsit in one of those other things with the other stories of the week, so
it could be just to have you denying it 
there was a slight pause, at the end of which murray bost henson came back
on the line sounding genuinely shaken  anyway116

chapter 27 

my old, i wont say what, how do you feel about having ridden on halleys
comet?
i havent, said arthur with a suppressed sigh, ridden on halleys comet 
ok, how do you feel about not having ridden on halleys comet?
pretty relaxed, murray 
fits in with the general weirdness of the week  all documented in his little black book,
it all checks out at every single funloving level  this man
is the bees knees, arthur, he is the wasps nipples  he is, i would go so far
as to say, the entire set of erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the
western world  nice, eh?
i think ive met him 
there was an impressed pause from murray bost hensons end of the phone  listen, do you know how much a tour operator is paying that guy not to
go to malaga this year? i mean forget irrigating the sahara and boring stuff
like that, this guy has a whole new career ahead of him, just avoiding places
for money  the mans turning into a monster, arthur, we might even have to
make him win the bingo 
we may need to photograph you under a garden shower, but thatll be ok 
where are you?
er, im in islington 

117

well, what about the real weirdness of the week, the real seriously loopy stuff  this is the real seethingly crazy one  locals are phoning in all the time to say theres this couple
who go flying nights  weve got guys down in our photo labs working through
the night to put together a genuine photograph  and i dont mean looking through walls or pretending to be
box girder bridges  you dont know anything?
no  give
me the address, im ready and writing  theyre gone  you cant sustain a story, you know, when the
only news is the continuing absence of whatever the storys about  maybe theyll run a little whatever hap-
pened to whatever happened to the dolphins story in a couple of years,
around august  but whats anybody going to do now? dolphins still gone?
continuing dolphin absence? dolphins - further days without them?
the story dies, arthur 
it lies down and kicks its little feet in the air and
presently goes to the great golden spike in the sky, my old fruitbat 
murray, im not interested in whether its a story 

118

chapter 27 



people are beginning to talk, said fenchurch that evening, after they had
hauled her cello in 
not only talk, said arthur, but print, in big bold letters under the bingo
prizes  which is why i thought id better get these  does that mean you managed to talk to
him?
i have had a day, said arthur, of extreme telephonic exhaustion 
youve obviously been working hard, youre drenched with sweat poor dar-
ling 
he sat down heavily, realized he was missing something and went to the fridge
to find it  i always know im in for a tough time
when my cello teacher looks me up and down and says, ah yes, my dear, i
think a little tchaikovsky today 

you dont suppose, said fenchurch, doubtfully, that theres anyone else we
can talk to?
it gets worse, said arthur, i spoke to someone on a science magazine who
actually knows him, and he said that john watson will not only believe, but
will actually have absolute proof, often dictated to him by angels with golden
beards and green wings and doctor scholl footwear, that the months most
fashionable silly theory is true  for people who question the validity of these
visions he will triumphantly produce the clogs in question, and thats as far
as you get 
i didnt realize it was that bad, said fenchurch quietly  she fiddled listlessly
with the tickets  her name, by the way, and you
may wish to know this, is arcane jill 
im glad you see  i thought you mightnt believe any of this, so when i called
her this time i used the telephone answering machine to record the call 
he went across to the telephone machine and fiddled and fumed with all its
buttons for a while, because it was the one which was particularly recom-
mended by which? magazine and is almost impossible to use without going
mad 
the voice was thin and crackly with its journey to a geostationary satellite
and back, but it was also hauntingly calm 
perhaps i should explain, arcane jill watsons voice said, that the phone
is in fact in a room that he never comes into 
wonko the sane does not like to enter the asylum and so he does not  i feel
you should know this because it may save you phoning 
arthurs voice, at its most mystified: im sorry, i dont understand  where
is the asylum?
where is the asylum? arcane jill watson again  have you ever read the
instructions on a packet of toothpicks?
on the tape, arthurs voice had to admit that he had not 

121

fenchurch looked up at him again with a thoughtful frown, and looked at the
tickets again 
getting it to go round corners is a bit of a problem, said the guy behind the
sunglasses as he handed them the keys, sometimes its simpler just to get out
and find a car thats going in that direction  theyve got a swimming
pool where you can go and watch english rock stars reading language, truth
and logic for the photographers 
the garage attendant didnt think much of their car, but that was fine because
they didnt either 
late in the evening they drove through the hollywood hills along mulholland
drive and stopped to look out first over the dazzling sea of floating light that
is los angeles, and later stopped to look across the dazzling sea of floating
light that is the san fernando valley  they agreed that the sense of dazzle
stopped immediately at the back of their eyes and didnt touch any other part
of them and came away strangely unsatisfied by the spectacle  as dramatic
seas of light went, it was fine, but light is meant to illuminate something, and
having driven through what this particularly dramatic sea of light was illumi-
nating they didnt think much of it 
they drove out along the freeway to santa monica for their first look at the
pacific ocean, the ocean which wonko the sane spent all his days and a good
deal of his nights looking at 
someone told me, said fenchurch, that they once overheard two old ladies126

chapter 30 
their mood lifted further as the sun began to move down the western half
of the sky, and by the time they were back in their rattling car and driving
towards a sunset that no one of any sensibility would dream of building a city
like los angeles on front of, they were suddenly feeling astonishingly and irra-
tionally happy and didnt even mind that the terrible old car radio would only
play two stations, and those simultaneously 
i know he will be able to help us, said fenchurch determinedly  whats his name again, that he likes to be called?
wonko the sane 
arthur wondered if he would and hoped that he would, and hoped that what
fenchurch had lost could be found here, on this earth, whatever this earth
might prove to be 
he hoped, as he had hoped continually and fervently since the time they had
talked together on the banks of the serpentine, that he would not be called
upon to try to remember something that he had very firmly and deliberately
buried in the furthest recesses of his memory, where he hoped it would cease
to nag at him 
fenchurch had red mullet and said it was delicious 
arthur had a swordfish steak and said it made him angry 
whys this fish so bloody good? he demanded, angrily 
please excuse my friend, said fenchurch to the startled waitress  i think
hes having a nice day at last 



if you took a couple of david bowies and stuck one of the david bowies on the
top of the other david bowie, then attached another david bowie to the end
of each of the arms of the upper of the first two david bowies and wrapped
the whole business up in a dirty beach robe you would then have something
which didnt exactly look like john watson, but which those who knew him
would find hauntingly familiar 
he was tall and he gangled 
when he sat in his deckchair gazing at the pacific, not so much with any
kind of wild surmise any longer as with a peaceful deep dejection, it was a
little difficult to tell exactly where the deckchair ended and he began, and
you would hesitate to put your hand on, say, his forearm in case the whole
structure suddenly collapsed with a snap and took your thumb off  well thats all right then  they sit right
where youre sitting 
he was talking of the angels with the golden beards and green wings and dr
scholl sandals 
they eat nachos which they say they cant get where they come from  are they? so, er   there were little sandpipers running
along the margin of the shore which seemed to have this problem: they needed128

chapter 31 

to find their food in the sand which a wave had just washed over, but they
couldnt bear to get their feet wet  to deal with this problem they ran with an
odd kind of movement as if theyd been constructed by somebody very clever
in switzerland 
fenchurch was sitting on the sand, idly drawing patterns in it with her fingers 
weekends, mostly, said wonko the sane, on little scooters 
a tiny cough from fenchurch attracted his attention and he looked round at
her  for a moment he thought she was trying to get him
excited, then he realized that she was rebuking him  who are we, she was
saying, to say hes mad?
his house was certainly peculiar, and since this was the first thing that fenchurch
and arthur had encountered it would help to know what it was like 
it folded back on itself like something that maurits c  escher, had he been
given to hard nights on the town, which is no part of this narratives purpose to
suggest was the case, though it is sometimes hard, looking at his pictures, par-
ticularly the one with the awkward steps, not to wonder, might have dreamed
up after having been on one, for the little chandeliers which should have been
hanging inside were on the outside pointing up  rough brickwork, nicely done
painting, guttering in good repair, a garden path, a couple of small trees, some
rooms leading off 
and the inner walls stretched down, folded curiously, and opened at the end
as if, by an optical illusion which would have had maurits c  escher frowning
and wondering how it was done, to enclose the pacific ocean itself 
hello, said john watson, wonko the sane 

129

good, they thought to themselves, hello is something we can cope with 
it gives me pleasure, he said, in a curious kind of way, and does nobody
any harm, he continued, that a competent optician couldnt correct 
your wife, said arthur, looking around, mentioned some toothpicks 
wonko the sane laughed 
ah yes, he said, thats to so with the day i finally realized that the world
had gone totally mad and built the asylum to put it in, poor thing, and hoped
it would get better 
here, said wonko the sane, we are outside the asylum  he pointed again
at the rough brickwork, the pointing and the guttering  ive tried to decorate it nicely to keep the in-
mates happy, but theres very little one can do  they are the words that finally turned me into the hermit i have now
become 
it seemed to me, said wonko the sane, that any civilization that had so
far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed instructions for use in
a packet of toothpicks, was no longer a civilization in which i could live and
stay sane 
he gazed out at the pacific again, as if daring it to rave and gibber at him,
but it lay there calmly and played with the sandpipers  which is why i call myself wonko the sane, just

130

chapter 31  wonko is what my mother called me when
i was a kid and clumsy and knocked things over, and sane is what i am, and
how, he added, with one of his smiles that made you feel, oh  well thats
all right then  shall we go on to the beach and see what
we have to talk about?
they went out on to the beach, which was where he started talking about
angels with golden beards and green wings and dr scholl sandals  said fenchurch gently, hopefully 
i can show you the sandals, said wonko the sane 
would you like me to show you, said wonko the sane, the sandals? i have
them  they are made by the dr scholl company, and the angels
say that they particularly suit the terrain they have to work in  when i say i dont know what that
means they say no, you dont, and laugh 
as he walked back towards the inside, or the outside depending on how you
looked at it, arthur and fenchurch looked at each other in a wondering and
slightly desperate sort of way, then each shrugged and idly drew figures in the
sand  it doesnt feel so odd in the sand  i just think this isnt our world 
what do you think he meant, she said, by the message?
i dont know, said arthur, though the memory of a man called prak who
laughed at him continuously kept nagging at him 
when wonko returned he was carrying something that stunned arthur  not
the sandals, they were perfectly ordinary wooden- bottomed sandals 
i just thought youd like to see, he said, what angels wear on their feet 
just out of curiousity  im not trying to prove anything, by the way  im a
scientist and i know what constitutes proof  so,
the other reason i call myself wonko the sane is so that people will think i
am a fool  you cant possibly
be a scientist if you mind people thinking that youre a fool 

131

this was the thing that arthur had been stunned to see him carrying, for it
was a wonderful silver-grey glass fish bowl, seemingly identical to the one in
arthurs bedroom 
finally his time had come, but he missed it by a millisecond 
arthur glanced at fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in his voice said, what?
have you seen one of these before?
yes, she said, ive got one  russell nicked it to put
his golfballs in  i dont know where it came from, just that i was angry with
russell for nicking it 
they both became aware that wonko the sane was glancing sharply back-
wards and forwards between them, and trying to get a gasp in edgeways 
he looked long and calmly at each of them, then he held up the bowl to catch
the light of the californian sun 
the bowl seemed almost to sing with the sun, to chime with the intensity of
its light, and cast darkly brilliant rainbows around the sand and upon them  they could see quite clearly in the fine tracery of
its etchwork the words so long, and thanks for all the fish 
do you know, asked wonko quietly, what it is?
they each shook their heads slowly, and with wonder, almost hypnotized by
the flashing of the lightning shadows in the grey glass 
it is a farewell gift from the dolphins, said wonko in a low quiet voice, the
dolphins whom i loved and studied, and swam with, and fed with fish, and
even tried to learn their language, a task which they seemed to make impossi-
bly difficult, considering the fact that i now realize they were perfectly capable
of communicating in ours if they decided they wanted to 
he tailed off 
youve done nothing else? no, he said, if you had, you would know  he

132

chapter 31 
my wife kept wheatgerm in ours, resumed wonko, with some new tone in
his voice, until last night  
i washed it, said wonko  have you held one to your ear?
they both shook their heads, again slowly, again dumbly 
the silent thunders of the deep 
waves of joy on - where? a world indescribably found, indescribably arrived
at, indescribably wet, a song of water 
a fugue of voices now, clamouring explanations, of a disaster unavertable, a
world to be destroyed, a surge of helplessness, a spasm of despair, a dying fall,
again the break of words 
and then the fling of hope, the finding of a shadow earth in the implications
of enfolded time, submerged dimensions, the pull of parallels, the deep pull,
the spin of will, the hurl and split of it, the flight 
and then the sound of long, heavy, perfectly grey bodies rolling away into an
unknown fathomless deep, quietly giggling 134

chapter 32 
this is what i wanted you to see, said wonko the sane when the news came
around again, an old colleague of mine  hes over in your country running an
investigation 
im afraid i cant comment on the name rain god at this present time, and
we are calling him an example of a spontaneous para- causal meteorological
phenomenon 
can you tell us what that means?
im not altogether sure  i mean if we just let you go around calling him a rain god, then
that suggests that you know something we dont, and im afraid we couldnt
have that 
and if it turns out that youre right, youll still be wrong, because we will
simply call him a   er supernormal  
- not paranormal or supernatural
because you think you know what those mean now, no, a supernormal in-
cremental precipitation inducer  well probably want to shove a quasi in
there somewhere to protect ourselves  admittedly, you wouldnt catch me going on holiday with
him  thanks, thatll be all for now, other than to say hi! to wonko if hes
watching 136

chapter 33 
i still have to know, said fenchurch, and i strongly feel that you know
something that youre not telling me 
what are you doing, sweetheart? she said, after he had spent twenty min-
utes frowning, chewing the pencil, scribbling on the paper, crossing things out,
scribbling again, chewing the pencil again and grunting irritably to himself  among all the scratchings and crossings out were the words
quentulus quazgar mountains  sevorbeupstry  planet of preliumtarn  sun-
zarss  galactic sector qq7 active j gamma 
and whats there?
apparently, said arthur, its gods final message to his creation 
that sounds a bit more like it, said fenchurch ?
yes, said fenchurch firmly, i really want to know 
arthur looked out of the scratchy little perspex window at the open sky out-
side 
excuse me, said the woman who had been looking at them rather oddly,
suddenly, i hope you dont think im rude  my names enid kapelsen, im from138

chapter 34  tell me, do you fly a lot?



they went to arthurs house in the west country, shoved a couple of towels
and stuff in a bag, and then sat down to do what every galactic hitch hiker
ends up spending most of his time doing 
they waited for a flying saucer to come by 
friend of mine did this for fifteen years, said arthur one night as they sat
forlornly watching the sky 
who was that?
called ford prefect 
he wondered where ford prefect was 
ford prefect turned up the day after that looking hung over and complaining
that arthur never answered the phone 
in fact he looked extremely ill, not merely as if hed been pulled through a
hedge backwards, but as if the hedge was being simultaneously pulled back-
wards through a combine harvester  he staggered into arthurs sitting room,
waving aside all offers of support, which was an error, because the effort caused
him to lose his balance altogether and arthur had eventually to drag him to
the sofa 
he followed arthur wobbily into the kitchen 

stupid operators keep asking you where youre calling from and you try and
tell them letchworth and they say you couldnt be if youre coming in on that
circuit  he looked about the place forlornly 
whats this? he said 
rice crispies 
i see, said ford, solemnly, and put the two items back down, one on top of
the other, but that didnt seem to balance properly, so he put the other on top
of the one and that seemed to work  what was i saying?
about not phoning from letchworth 
i wasnt  bugger letchworth, i said, if thats
your attitude  i am in fact calling from a sales scoutship of the sirius cyber-
netics corporation, currently on the sub-light-speed leg of a journey between
the stars known on your world, though not necessarily to you, dear lady  -
i said dear lady, explained ford prefect, because i didnt want her to be
offended by my implication that she was an ignorant cretin   youll have to assist me
again, he continued, by reminding me what i was talking about 
between the stars, said arthur, known on your world, though not neces-
sarily to you, dear lady, as  
pleiades epsilon and pleiades zeta, concluded ford triumphantly  this
conversation lark is quite gas isnt it?
have some coffee 
and the reason, i said, why i am bothering you with it
rather than just dialling direct as i could, because we have some pretty sophis-
ticated telecommunications equipment out here in the pleiades, i can tell you,
is that the penny pinching son of a starbeast piloting this son of a starbeast
spaceship insists that i call collect  can you believe that?
and could she?
i dont know  so! what do you
suppose, he asked fiercely, i did next?
ive no idea, ford, said arthur  they really are the creeps of the cosmos, buzzing around
the celestial infinite with their junky little machines that never work properly
or, when they do, perform functions that no sane man would require of them
and, he added savagely, go beep to tell you when theyve done it!
this was perfectly true, and a very respectable view widely held by right think-
ing people, who are largely recognizable as being right thinking people by the
mere fact that they hold this view 
the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy, in a moment of reasoned lucidity
which is almost unique among its current tally of five million, nine hundred
and seventy-five thousand, five hundred and nine pages, says of the sirius
cybernetics corporation product that it is very easy to be blinded to the
essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting
them to work at all 
and this guy, ranted ford, was on a drive to sell more of them! his five-
year mission to seek out and explore strange new worlds, and sell advanced
music substitute systems to their restaurants, elevators and wine bars! or if
they didnt have restaurants, elevators and wine bars yet, to artificially accel-
erate their civilization growth until they bloody well did have! wheres that
coffee!
i threw it away  i saved civiliza-
tion as we know it 
it was better, he said sullenly, last time, and waved vaguely in the direc-
tion of another broken chair which he had already got trussed up on the dining
table 

i see, said arthur, casting a placid eye over the trussed up wreckage, and,
er, what are all the ice cubes for?
what? screamed ford  what? you missed that bit too? thats the sus-
pended animation facility! i put the guy in the suspended animation facility 
well i had to didnt i?
so it would seem, said arthur, in his placid voice 
dont touch that!!! yelled ford 
arthur, who was about to replace the phone, which was for some mysterious
reason lying on the table, off the hook, paused, placidly 
beep, beep, beep, said ford, is exactly what is being heard all over that
guys ship, while he sleeps, in the ice, going slowly round a little-known moon
of sesefras magna 
why? he said, placidly 
anyway, he said, dramatic arrival dont you think?



the flying saucer in which ford prefect had stowed away had stunned the
world 
finally there was no doubt, no possibility of mistake, no hallucinations, no
mysterious cia agents found floating in reservoirs 
it had come down with a wonderful disregard for anything beneath it and
crushed a large area of some of the most expensive real estate in the world,
including much of harrods 
a hatchway opened, crashed down through the harrods food halls, demol-
ished harvey nicholls, and with a final grinding scream of tortured architec-
ture, toppled the sheraton park tower 
after a long, heart-stopping moment of internal crashes and grumbles of rend-
ing machinery, there marched from it, down the ramp, an immense silver robot,
a hundred feet tall 
i come in peace, it said, adding after a long moment of further grinding,
take me to your lizard 
so, said arthur, hoping he wasnt sounding ridiculously obtuse, why dont
people get rid of the lizards?
it honestly doesnt occur to them, said ford  theyve all got the vote, so
they all pretty much assume that the government theyve voted in more or less
approximates to the government they want 
but, said arthur, going for the big one again, why?
because if they didnt vote for a lizard, said ford, the wrong lizard might
get in  theyre completely wrong of course, completely and utterly
wrong, but someones got to say it 
but thats terrible, said arthur 
listen, bud, said ford, if i had one altairan dollar for every time i heard
one bit of the universe look at another bit of the universe and say thats
terrible i wouldnt be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin  but i havent
and i am  anyway, what are you looking so placid and moon-eyed for? are
you in love?
arthur said yes, he was, and said it placidly 
with someone who knows where the gin bottle is? do i get to meet her?
he did because fenchurch came in at that moment with a pile of newspapers
shed been into the village to buy  she stopped in astonishment at the wreck-
age on the table and the wreckage from betelgeuse on the sofa 
wheres the gin? said ford to fenchurch  and to arthur, what happened
to trillian by the way?
er, this is fenchurch, said arthur, awkwardly 
oh, yeah, said ford, she went off with zaphod somewhere  at least, he added, i think thats what they were  za-
phods calmed down a lot you know 
really? said arthur, clustering hurriedly round fenchurch to relieve her of
the shopping 
yeah, said ford, at least one of his heads is now saner than an emu on
acid 
arthur, who is this? said fenchurch

chapter 36 



for a total of three days and nights the giant silver robot stood in stunned
amazement straddling the remains of knightsbridge, swaying slightly and try-
ing to work out a number of things 
government deputations came to see it, ranting journalists by the truckload
asked each other questions on the air about what they thought of it, flights
of fighter bombers tried pathetically to attack it - but no lizards appeared 
one of them at last found a pet shop with some lizards, but it instantly de-
fended the pet shop for democracy so savagely that little in the area survived 
a turning point came when a crack team of flying screechers discovered the
zoo in regents park, and most particularly the reptile house 
learning a little caution from their previous mistakes in the petshop, the flying
drills and fretsaws brought some of the larger and fatter iguanas to the giant
silver robot, who tried to conduct high-level talks with them 
eventually the robot announced to the world that despite the full, frank and
wide-ranging exchange of views the high level talks had broken down, the
lizards had been retired, and that it, the robot would take a short holiday
somewhere, and for some reason selected bournemouth 148

chapter 37 

the flying toolkits screeched and sawed and drilled and fried things with light
throughout that day and all through the night time, and in the morning,
stunningly, a giant mobile gantry started to roll westwards on several roads
simultaneously with the robot standing on it, supported within the gantry 
westward it crawled, like a strange carnival buzzed around by its servants and
helicopters and news coaches, scything through the land until at last it came
to bournemouth, where the robot slowly freed itself from it transport systems
embraces and went and lay for ten days on the beach 
it was, of course, by far the most exciting thing that had ever happened to
bournemouth 
i think theres a story in it, confided the journalist over a cigarette shared
through the steel link fence, but it needs a good local angle  ive got a little
list of questions here, he went on, rummaging awkwardly in an inner pocket,
perhaps you could get him, it, whatever you call him, to run through them
quickly 
the little flying ratchet screwdriver said it would see what it cold do and
screeched off 
curiously, however, the questions on the piece of paper more or less exactly
matched the questions that were going through the massive battle-scarred in-
dustrial quality circuits of the robots mind 
the point is, said fenchurch to ford, can you get us on board?
ford looked wildly at his watch 



crowds thronged as close as they could to the giant silver craft, which wasnt
very 
the inner perimeter fence was now being dismantled 
the giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime, and now it
was five oclock in the afternoon and no further sign had been seen of it  much
had been heard - more grindings and rumblings from deep within the craft,
the music of a million hideous malfunctions; but the sense of tense expecta-
tion among the crowd was born of the fact that they tensely expected to be
disappointed  arthur and fenchurch
scanned the crowd anxiously, unable to find ford prefect in it anywhere, or
any sign that he had the slightest intention of being there 
how reliable is he? asked fenchurch in a sinking voice  the soldiers on guard round
the ramp bristled meaningfully, orders were barked back and forth, hurried150

chapter 38 
hopelessly, and with no clear plan now, arthur and fenchurch pushed forward
through the crowd, but since the whole crowd was also trying to push forward
through the crowd, this got them nowhere 
the sounds of mechanical disarray from within changed in intensity, and slowly,
heavily, the huge steel ramp began to lift itself back out of the harrods food
halls 
hold it!
a megaphone barked from a taxi which screeched to a halt on the edge of the
milling crowd 
there has been, barked the megaphone, a major scientific break-in! through  the door flew open and a small man from
somewhere in the vicinity of betelgeuse leapt out wearing a white coat 
hold it! he shouted again, and this time brandished a short squad black rod
with lights on it  the lights winked briefly, the ramp paused in its ascent, and
then in obedience to the signals from the thumb (which half the electronic
engineers in the galaxy are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming,
while the other half are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming the
jamming signals), slowly ground its way downwards again 
ford prefect grabbed his megaphone from out of the taxi and started bawling
at the crowd through it 
completely at random he pointed at arthur and fenchurch, who wrestled their
way back out of the crowd and clustered urgently round the taxi  its all under
control, theres nothing to see 
hang your coat over them, he muttered to fenchurch as he heaved them out

151

to her  hurriedly he manoeuvred out the large supermarket trolley that was
also jammed against the back seat  everythings under proper sci-
entific control 
he said youd pay, said the taxi-driver to arthur, who dug out some notes
and paid him  theres nothing to see, its all over 
clear the way, please, boomed a police megaphone from the back of the
crowd  theres been a break-in, clear the way 
beneath them, the huge ramp juddered and began slowly to heave its way
upwards 

152

chapter 38 
they were claustrophobic and ill-lit  the lighting circuits buzzed annoyingly 
this wasnt it, though 
he paused and leaned backwards as a flying power drill flew past him down
the dim corridor with a nasty screech, occasionally clanging against the walls
like a confused bee as it did so 
that wasnt it either 
he came to an observation monitor let into the wall behind a plate of tough-
ened but still badly scratched perspex 
would you turn it down please? he said to ford prefect who was crouching
in front of it in the middle of a pile of bits of video equipment hed taken from
a shop window in tottenham court road, having first hurled a small brick
through it, and also a nasty heap of empty beer cans  he listened to fords whoops and yells and yeehays as placidly as
he could 

ford, he said eventually, when it was all over, and ford was hunting through
a stack of cassettes for the tape of casablanca, how come, if  
i saw half of
it again the night before the vogons came  when they blew the place up i
thought id never get to see it  i
prefer this stuff, he said as ricks bar flickered on to the screen 
how come if youre so rude about the earth, that you  
beyond what used to be known as the limitless lightfields of flanux until
the grey binding fiefdoms of saxaquine were discovered lying behind them,
lie the grey binding fiefdoms of saxaquine  within the grey binding fief-
doms of saxaquine lies the star named zarss, around which orbits the planet
preliumtarn in which is the land of sevorbeupstry, and it was to the land of
sevorbeupstry that arthur and fenchurch came at last, a little tired by the
journey 
and in the land of sevorbeupstry, they came to the great red plain of rars,
which was bounded on the south side by the quentulus quazgar mountains,
on the further side of which, according to the dying words of prak, they would
find in thirty- foot-high letters of fire gods final message to his creation 
according to prak, if arthurs memory saved him right, the place was guarded
by the lajestic vantrashell of lob, and so, after a manner, it proved to be 
keep to the left, please, he said, keep to the left, and hurried on past them
on a little scooter 
do you know what the message is? they asked the wizened little lady in the
booth 
is it possible, asked arthur at one of the larger booths, to rent one of those
little scooters? like the one lajestic ventrawhatsit had 
oh well, thats easy then, said fenchurch, were not particularly devout 
then you must turn back now, said the little lady severely, and when they
demurred, sold them a couple of final message sunhats and a photograph of
themselves with their arms tight around each other on the great red plain of
rars 
they drank a couple of sodas in the shade of the booth and then trudged out
into the sun again 
were running out of border cream, said fenchurch after a few more miles 
some way ahead of them an awkward low shape was heaving itself wretchedly
along the ground, stumbling painfully slowly, half- limping, half-crawling  is that you?
you were always one, groaned the aged husk of the robot, for the super-
intelligent question, werent you?
what is it? whispered fenchurch in alarm, crouching behind arthur, and
grasping on to his arm  hes sort of an old friend, said arthur 
friend! croaked the robot pathetically  youll have to excuse me while
i try and remember what the word means  my memory banks are not what
they were you know, and any word which falls into disuse for a few zillion years

157

has to get shifted down into auxiliary memory back-up 
no, he said at last, dont think i ever came across one of those 
he scraped a knee along pathetically in the dust, an then tried to twist himself
up on his misshapen elbows 
dont seem to be any doors around at present, he said, but im sure that if
we waited long enough, someone would build one  im
quite used to waiting you know 
arthur, hissed fenchurch in his ear sharply, you never told me of this 
what have you done to this poor creature?
nothing, insisted arthur sadly, hes always like this   what do you know of always?
you say always to me, who, because of the silly little errands your organic
lifeforms keep on sending me through time on, am now thirty-seven times older
than the universe itself? pick your words with a little more care, he coughed,
and tact 
they carried him with them along the path that ran along the left of the great
red plain of rars toward the encircling mountains of quentulus quazgar 
arthur attempted to explain to fenchurch, but was too often interrupted by
marvins dolorous cybernetic ravings 

im all spare parts, he droned  he seemed almost imperceptibly to brighten for a moment  i had been given
the intellect- stretching task of taking you up to the bridge? i mentioned to
you that i had this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side? that i
had asked for them to be replaced but they never were?
he left a longish pause before he continued 
ouch, he added, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch  fenchurch bought some cufflinks for russell,
cufflinks that had set in them little polished pebbles which had been picked
up from the quentulus quazgar mountains, directly underneath the letters of
fire in which was written gods final message to his creation 
they rounded the foot of the quentulus quazgar mountains, and there was
the message written in blazing letters along the crest of the mountain 
it had a little
pay-telescope for looking at the letters in detail, but no one would ever use it
because the letters burned with the divine brilliance of the heavens and would,
if seen through a telescope, have severely damaged the retina and optic nerve 
they gazed at gods final message in wonderment, and were slowly and
ineffably filled with a great sense of peace, and of final and complete un-
derstanding 
fenchurch sighed  he complained and in-

159

sulted them, but they helped him look at each individual letter in turn, the
first letter was a w, the second an e 
luckily, there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters from guys with
green wings 



epilogue

one of the greatest benefactors of all lifekind was a man who couldnt keep
his mind on the job in hand 
the problem was that he was far too interested in things which he shouldnt
be interested in, at least, as people would tell him, not now 
so when his world was threatened by terrible invaders from a distant star, who
were still a fair way off but travelling fast, he, blart versenwald iii (his name
was blart versenwald iii, which is not strictly relevant, but quite interesting
because - never mind, that was his name and we can talk about why its inter-
esting later), was sent into guarded seclusion by the masters of his race with
instructions to design a breed of fanatical superwarriors to resist and vanquish
the feared invaders, do it quickly and, they told him, concentrate!
so he sat by a window and looked out at a summer lawn and designed and
designed and designed, but inevitably got a little distracted by things, and by
the time the invaders were practically in orbit round them, had come up with
a remarkable new breed of super-fly that could, unaided, figure out how to
fly through the open half of a half-open window, and also an off- switch for
children  celebrations of these remarkable achievements seemed doomed to be
shortlived because disaster was imminent as the alien ships were landing  but
astoundingly, the fearsome invaders who, like most warlike races were only on162

chapter 41  epilogue

the rampage because they couldnt cope with things at home, were stunned by
versenwalds extraordinary breakthroughs, joined in the celebrations and were
instantly prevailed upon to sign a wide-ranging series of trading agreements
and set up a programme of cultural exchanges 

it doesnt necessarily do it in chronological order, though 
one of the problems has to do with the speed of light and the difficulties in-
volved in trying to exceed it  the hingefreel people of arkintoofle minor did try to build spaceships
that were powered by bad news but they didnt work particularly well and were
so extremely unwelcome whenever they arrived anywhere that there wasnt re-
ally any point in being there 
so, by and large, the peoples of the galaxy tended to languish in their own
local muddles and the history of the galaxy itself was, for a long time, largely
cosmological 
which is not to say that people werent trying  they tried sending off fleets
of spaceships to do battle or business in distant parts, but these usually took
thousands of years to get anywhere  by the time they eventually arrived,
other forms of travel had been discovered which made use of hyperspace to
circumvent the speed of light, so that whatever battles it was that the slower-
than-light fleets had been sent to fight had already been taken care of centuries
earlier by the time they actually got there   they were trained, they were ready, theyd had a couple of thousand
years sleep, theyd come a long way to do a tough job and by zarquon they
were going to do it 
this was when the first major muddles of galactic history set in, with bat-
tles continually re-erupting centuries after the issues they had been fought
over had supposedly been settled  however, these muddles were as nothing
to the ones which historians had to try and unravel once time-travel was dis-6

chapter 1  when the infinite improbability drive arrived and whole planets
started turning unexpectedly into banana fruitcake, the great history faculty of
the university of maximegalon finally gave up, closed itself down and surren-
dered its buildings to the rapidly growing joint faculty of divinity and water
polo, which had been after them for years 
which is all very well, of course, but it almost certainly means that no one will
ever know for sure where, for instance, the grebulons came from, or exactly
what it was they wanted 

the huge grey grebulon reconnaissance ship moved silently through the black
void 
it was just one dark speck frozen against an infinite granularity of brilliant
night 
hmmm 
a low level supervising program woke up a slightly higher level supervising
program deep in the ships semi-somnolent cyberbrain and reported to it that
whenever it went click all it got was a hum 
the higher level supervising program asked it what it was supposed to get,
and the low level supervising program said that it couldnt remember exactly,
but thought it was probably more of a sort of distant satisfied sigh, wasnt it?
it didnt know what this hum was 
the higher level supervising program considered this and didnt like it 
it
asked the low level supervising program what exactly it was supervising and
the low level supervising program said it couldnt remember that either, just
that it was something that was meant to go click, sigh every ten years or so,
which usually happened without fail  it had tried to consult its error look-up

7

table but couldnt find it, which was why it had alerted the higher level su-
pervising program to the problem  
it couldnt find the look-up table   it tried to look up the error
message in its error message look-up table and couldnt find that either  it
allowed a couple of nanoseconds to go by while it went through all this again  it called its supervis-
ing agent which hit problems too  within a few millionths of a second virtual
circuits that had lain dormant, some for years, some for centuries, were flaring
into life throughout the ship 
small modules of software - agents - surged through the logical pathways,
grouping, consulting, re-grouping  they quickly established that the ships
memory, all the way back to its central mission module, was in tatters  even
the central mis- sion module itself seemed to be damaged  replace the central
mission module 
it had to be physically replaced because, for safety reasons, there
was no link whatsoever between the original and its backup  once the central
mission module was replaced it could itself supervise the reconstruction of the
rest of the system in every detail, and all would be well 
robots were instructed to bring the backup central mission module from the
shielded strong room, where they guarded it, to the ships logic chamber for
installation 
this involved the lengthy exchange of emergency codes and protocols as the
robots interrogated the agents as to the authen- ticity of the instructions  they unpacked
the backup central mission module from its storage housing, carried it out of
the storage chamber, fell out of the ship and went spinning off into the void  this turned out to
be impossible, because the ships sensors couldnt see that there was a hole,
and the supervisors which should have said that the sensors werent working
properly werent working properly and kept saying that the sensors were fine 
the ship tried to think intelligently about this, failed, and then blanked out
completely for a bit  it didnt realise it had blanked out, of course, because
it had blanked out  after the
third time the stars jumped the ship finally realised that it must be blanking
out, and that it was time to take some serious decisions 
then it realised it hadnt actually taken the serious decisions yet and panicked 
it blanked out again for a bit 
it clearly hadnt got to its destination yet, it thought, fitfully, but since it no
longer had the faintest idea where its destina- tion was or how to reach it,
there seemed to be little point in continuing  it consulted what tiny scraps of
instructions it could reconstruct from the tatters of its central mission mod-
ule 
before it blanked out for good the ship would have to pass on those instruc-
tions, such as they were, to its more primitive subsidiary systems  while the crew was in hibernation, the minds
of all of its members, their memories, their identities and their understanding
of what they had come to do, had all been transferred into the ships central
mission module for safe keeping 
just before it blanked out for the final time, the ship realised that its engines
were beginning to give out too 
as far as finding something to land on was concerned, they didnt do very
well  the planet they found was desolately cold and lonely, so achingly far
from the sun that should warm it, that it took all of the envir-o-form ma-
chinery and lifesupport-o- systems they carried with them to render it, or at
least enough parts of it, habitable  there were better planets nearer in, but
the ships strateej-o-mat was obviously locked into lurk mode and chose the
most distant and unobtrusive planet and, further- more, would not be gainsaid
by anybody other than the ships chief strategic officer  since everybody on
the ship had lost their minds no one knew who the chief strategic officer was
or, even if he could have been identified, how he was supposed to go about
gainsaying the ships strateej-o-mat  anywhere it can get some kind of a grip, whether its the
intoxicating seas of santraginus v, where the fish never seem to care whatever
the heck kind of direction they swim in, the fire storms of frastra where, they
say, life begins at 40,000 degrees, or just burrowing around in the lower intes-
tine of a rat for the sheer unadulterated hell of it, life will always find a way
of hanging on in somewhere  the last time
anybody made a list of the top hundred character attributes of new yorkers,
common sense snuck in at number 79  its one thing to be the sort of life form that
thrives on heat and finds, as the frastrans do, that the temperature range be-
tween 40,000 and 40,004 is very equable, but its quite another to be the sort of
animal that has to wrap itself up in lots of other animals at one point in your
planets orbit, and then find, half an orbit later, that your skins bubbling  a lot of the inhabitants of new york will honk on might-
ily about the pleasures of spring, but if they actually knew the first thing
about the pleasures of spring they would know of at least five thousand nine
hundred and eighty- three better places to spend it than new york, and thats
just on the same latitude  when its fall in new
york, the air smells as if someones been frying goats in it, and if you are keen
to breathe, the best plan is to open a window and stick your head in a building 

tricia mcmillan loved new york  soho  delis  yo  yo also  tricia had just been to see woody allens new movie which
was all about the angst of being neurotic in new york  he had made one or
two other movies that had explored the same theme, and tricia wondered if
he had ever considered moving, but heard that he had set his face against the
idea 
tricia loved new york because loving new york was a good career move  tricia was a tv anchor person, and new york
was where most of the worlds tv was anchored  tricias tv anchoring had
been done exclusively in britain up to that point: regional news, then breakfast
news, early evening news  she had what it took: great hair, a profound
understand- ing of strategic lip gloss, the intelligence to understand the world
and a tiny secret interior deadness which meant she didnt care 
tricia had only ever missed one opportunity  these days it didnt even make
her tremble quite so much as it used to to think about it  mo minetti was leaving the us/am breakfast
show to have a baby  teams of nbs lawyers had sieved through her
contract to see if these constituted legitimate grounds, but in the end, reluc-
tantly, they had to let her go  the
hair, the skin tone and the bridgework would have to be up to american net-
work standards, but there had been a lot of british accents up there thanking
their mothers for their oscars, a lot of british accents singing on broadway,
and some unusually big audiences tuning in to british accents in wigs on mas-
terpiece theatre  british accents were telling jokes on david letterman and
jay leno 
that was why tricia was here  since she was chasing something like ten times her present salary,
they might have felt that she could have forked out her own expenses, but
shed found a story, found a pretext, kept very quiet about anything ulterior,
and theyd stumped up for the trip  the right moves had got
her a nice room at the brentwood and here she was, wondering what to do
next  the actual job
she had come to do she had done in a morning; the imagined job she was after
was only shimmering tantalisingly on an unreachable horizon  the cab
couldnt get close to the kerb because a big stretch limo was hogging all the
available space and she had to squeeze her way past it  the fine cotton of
her blouse was sticking like grime to her skin  her hair felt as if shed bought
it at a fairground on a stick  she couldnt bear sitting in a hotel room waiting  what she wanted more than anything else in the world was a job in amer-
ican television at ten times her current salary 
she sat on a chair in the lobby, under a kentia palm, and opened the little
cellophane-windowed envelope  the name was gail
andrews 
gail andrews 
it wasnt a name she was expecting  it caught her unawares  she recognised it,
but couldnt immediately say why  was she andy martins secretary? hilary
basss assistant? martin and bass were the two major contact calls she had
made, or tried to make, at nbs  was this woody allen trying to contact her
under an assumed name? it was a 212 area code number  well, that narrowed it down a bit, didnt
it?
she went back to the receptionist at the desk  someone i
dont know has tried to call me and says shes not happy 
no, tricia said  sounds like shes not happy about some-
thing 
yes, said tricia 
looks like theres a name here, said the receptionist  gail andrews  do
you know anybody of that name?
no, said tricia 
any idea what shes unhappy about?
no, said tricia 
have you called the number? theres a number here  im just trying to get some
more information before i ring back  perhaps i could talk to the person who
took the call?
hmmm, said the receptionist, scrutinising the note carefully  i dont think
we have anybody called gail andrews here 
no, i realise that, said tricia  i just -
im gail andrews 
the voice came from behind tricia 
im sorry?
im gail andrews  i hadnt heard so i came by  i
didnt want to miss you 
i dont know about this, said the receptionist, for whom speed was not an
issue  would you like me to try this number for you now?
no, thatll be fine, thanks, said tricia 
i can call this room number here for you if thatll help, said the receptionist,
peering at the note again 
no, that wont be necessary, thanks, said tricia  thats my own room
number  im the one the message was for  i think weve sorted this out now 
tricia didnt particularly want to have a nice day 
she also didnt want to talk to gail andrews  she had a very strict cut-off
point as far as fraternising with the christians was concerned  her colleagues
called her interview subjects chris- tians and would often cross themselves
when they saw one walking innocently into the studio to face tricia, particu-
larly if tricia was smiling warmly and showing her teeth 
gail andrews was a well groomed woman in her mid-forties  her clothes fell
within the boundaries defined by expensive good taste, but were definitely
huddled up at the floatier end of those boundaries  she was an astrologer
- a famous and, if rumour were true, influential astrologer, having allegedly
influenced a number of decisions made by the late president hudson, including
every- thing from which flavour of cream whip to have on which day of the
week, to whether or not to bomb damascus 
tricia had savaged her more than somewhat  at
the time ms andrews had emphati- cally denied advising president hudson
on anything other than personal, spiritual or dietary matters, which did not,
apparently include the bombing of damascus )
no, this was a neat topical little angle that tricia had come up with about the
whole issue of astrology itself  what to do?
i can wait for you in the bar, if you need a few minutes, said gail andrews 
but i would like to talk to you, and im leaving the city tonight 

ok, said tricia  apart from anything else, she had so little faith in
the ability of the guy on the message desk at reception to deal with anything
as complicated as a message that she wanted to be doubly certain that there
wasnt a note under the door  it wouldnt be the first time that messages at
the desk and messages under the door had been completely at odds with each
other 
there wasnt one 
yes? said tricia 
not what? said tricia 
hippy  guy says hes not a hippy  you want the number?
as she started to dictate the number tricia suddenly realised that this was
just a garbled version of the message she had already had  are there any other messages for me?
room number?
tricia couldnt work out why the operator should suddenly ask for her number
this late in the conversation, but gave it to her anyway 
name?
mcmillan, tricia mcmillan  tricia spelt it, patiently 
not mr macmanus?
no 
tricia sighed and dialled again  this time she gave her name and room num-
ber all over again, up front  the operator showed not the slightest glimmer of
recognition that they had been speak- ing less than ten seconds ago 
im going to be in the bar, tricia explained  if a phone call
comes through for me, please would you put it through to me in the bar?
name?
they went through it all a couple more times till tricia was certain that ev-
erything that possibly could be clear was as clear as it possibly could be 
she showered, put on fresh clothes and retouched her makeup with the speed
of a professional, and, looking at her bed with a sigh, left the room again 
she was just going to have to tough it out with gail andrews  sorry but thats the game were all in - that sort of
thing  but theres no such thing as a
free launch 
what had happened was this:
last week astronomers had announced that they had at last discovered a tenth
planet, out beyond the orbit of pluto  they had been searching for it for years,
guided by certain orbital anomalies in the outer planets, and now theyd found
it and they were all terribly pleased, and everyone was terribly happy for them
and so on  the planet was named persephone, but rapidly nicknamed rupert
after some astronomers parrot - there was some tediously heart-warming story
attached to this - and that was all very wonderful and lovely 
tricia had followed the story with, for various reasons, con- siderable interest 
then, while she had been casting around for a good excuse to go to new york
at her tv companys expense she had happened to notice a press release about
gail andrews, and her new book, you and your planets 
gail andrews was not exactly a household name, but the moment you men-
tioned president hudson, cream whips and the amputation of damascus (the
world had moved on from surgi- cal strikes  the official term had in fact been
damascectomy, meaning the taking out of damascus), everyone remem-
bered who you meant 
tricia saw an angle here which she quickly sold to her producer 
surely the notion that great lumps of rock whirling in space knew something
about your day that you didnt must take a bit of a knock from the fact that
there was suddenly a new lump of rock out there that nobody had known
about before 
that must throw a few calculations out, mustnt it?
what about all those star charts and planetary motions and so? we all knew
(apparently) what happened when neptune was in virgo, and so on, but what
about when rupert was rising? wouldnt the whole of astrology have to be
rethought? wouldnt now perhaps be a good time to own up that it was all just
a load of hogwash and instead take up pig-farming, the principles of which were
founded on some kind of rational basis? if wed known about rupert three
years ago, might president hudson have been eating the boysenberry flavour
on thursday rather than friday? might damascus still be standing? that
sort of thing 
gail andrews had taken it all reasonably well 

from the initial onslaught, when she made the rather serious mistake of trying
to shake tricia off by talking smoothly about diurnal arcs, right ascensions
and some of the more abstruse areas of three-dimensional trigonometry 
to her shock she discovered that everything she delivered to tricia came right
back at her with more spin on it than she could cope with  nobody had warned
gail that being a tv bimbo was, for tricia, her second stab at a role in life 
behind her chanel lip gloss, her coupe sauvage and her crystal blue contact
lenses lay a brain that had acquired for itself, in an earlier, abandoned phase
of her life, a first class degree in mathematics and a doctorate in astrophysics 

as she was getting into the elevator tricia, slightly preoccupied, realised
she had left her bag in her room and wondered whether to duck back out and
get it  it was probably safer where it was and there wasnt anything she
particularly needed in it 
anyone who didnt know tricia mcmillan better would have said that that was
exactly the way people sometimes stared upwards when they were trying to
hold back tears 
now, im going to write this out, she said, because i dont want anything
to go wrong 
thats in case theres a message for me 
you want me to see if shes in her room? he said 

two minutes later, tricia swivelled into the bar seat next to gail andrews,

who was sitting in front of a glass of white wine 
you struck me as the sort of person who preferred to sit up at the bar rather
than demurely at a table, she said 
this was true, and caught tricia a little by surprise 
vodka? said gail  she just stopped herself asking, how did you

19

know? but gail answered anyway 
the barman had her vodka ready for her and slid it charmingly across the
glossy mahogany 
she didnt know quite what to make out of all this sudden niceness and was
determined not to be wrong-footed by it 
ms andrews, she said, firmly, im sorry that youre not happy  i know you
probably feel i was a bit rough with you this morning, but astrology is, after
all, just popular entertainment, which is fine  its part of showbiz and its a
part that you have done well out of and good luck to you  its not
a science though, and it shouldnt be mistaken for one  i think thats some-
thing we both managed to demonstrate very successfully together this morn-
ing, while at the same time generating some popular entertainment, which is
what we both do for a living  im sorry if you have a problem with that 
im perfectly happy, said gail andrews 
no, said gail andrews 
tricia felt as if she had been kicked in the back of the head 
tricia stared at her  ms andrews -  she started, and then realised that the
way she had said it sounded exactly angry and unhappy and rather under-
mined the protest she had been trying to make 
please call me gail, if thats ok 
tricia just looked bewildered 
i know that astrology isnt a science, said gail  of course it isnt  its just
an arbitrary set of rules like chess or tennis or, whats that strange thing you
british play?
er, cricket? self-loathing?
parliamentary democracy  they dont make
any kind of sense except in terms of them- selves  in astrology the rules happen to be
about stars and planets, but they could be about ducks and drakes for all the

20

chapter 2  the more rules, the tinier the
rules, the more arbitrary they are, the better  it lets you see the words that were written on the piece of paper above
it thats now been taken away and hidden  the graphites not important  so you see, astrologys nothing
to do with astronomy 
so when you got so, i dont know, so emotionally focused on stars and planets
this morning, i began to think, shes not angry about astrology, she really is
angry and unhappy about actual stars and planets  people usually only get
that unhappy and angry when theyve lost something  thats all i could think
and i couldnt make any more sense of it than that 
tricia was stunned 
it was
busy constructing all sorts of rebuttals to do with how ridiculous newspaper
horoscopes were and the sort of statistical tricks they played on people  but
gradually it petered out, because it realised that the rest of her brain wasnt
listening 
she turned to look at gail 
this completely flummoxed her  it was not designed to suggest that nowadays
even an expensive and elegant hotel in new york couldnt be sure that its
clientele wasnt suddenly going to pull a gun or not wear a tie  but carefully
hidden though it was behind the vodka, it couldnt deceive the finely honed
instinct of a tv anchor person, which was to know exactly when a camera was
turning to look at her 
is something wrong? asked gail  i have to say that youve rather astonished me, said tricia  she de-
cided to ignore the security camera  it wasnt the
first time it had happened  a traffic monitoring camera, she was convinced,
had swung round to follow her as she walked past it, and a secu- rity camera in
bloomingdales had seemed to make a particular point of watching her trying

21

on hats  she was obviously going dotty 
she decided to put it out of her mind and took a sip of her vodka  someone
was walking round the bar asking people if they were mr macmanus 
ok, she said, suddenly blurting it out  i dont know how you worked it
out, but 
i didnt work it out, as you put it  most
of them we dont notice 
oh yes, i noticed, said tricia  i said
to him to wait while i went to get my bag and then id be happy to go off to
another planet with him  he said i wouldnt need my bag  i said he obviously
came from a very backward planet or hed know that a woman always needed
to take her bag with her  he got a bit impatient, but i wasnt gong to be a
complete pushover just because he said he was from another planet 
tricia paused ? said gail  but hardly a moment of this life goes by that i
dont wonder about some other me  a me that didnt go back for her bag  i
feel like shes out there somewhere and im walking in her shadow 
a member of the hotel staff was now going round the bar asking people if they
were mr miller  person was from another planet? asked gail 
two? didnt anybody else notice?
it was a fancy dress party  he tapped on the cage and it did a lot of stupid
pretty polly stuff and squawking and so on 
i think you probably did the right thing, dear, dont you? said gail 
no, said tricia  no i dont  and i couldnt carry on doing what i was
doing either  you cant be an astrophysi-
cist properly if youve actually met someone from another planet whos got a
second head that pretends to be a parrot  i couldnt at
least  and thats probably why you tend to be a little
hard on other people who talk what sounds like complete nonsense 
yes, said tricia  i expect youre right  im sorry 
thats ok 
youre the first person ive ever told this, by the way  so hard to tell these days isnt it? but youre right to ask because
that was probably the reason  what do you tell someone? at one point i even
thought i might just go to a sperm bank and take pot luck  have somebodys
child at random 
you cant seriously do that, can you?
tricia laughed  thats
why im in television i guess 
excuse me lady, your name tricia mcmillan?
tricia looked round in surprise  there was a man standing there in a chauffeurs
hat  hotel said they didnt have
anybody of that name, but i checked back with mr martins office and they
said that this was definitely where you staying  in the end i get the office to fax a picture of you through to the car
and have a look myself 
may be a bit late now, but do you want to go anyway?
tricia was stunned 
mr martin? you mean andy martin at nbs?
thats correct, lady 
tricia shot up out of her seat  she couldnt even bear to think of all the mes-
sages shed heard for mr macmanus and mr miller  as i heard it mr martin thinks
it might be worth trying a british accent  thats mr zwingler, and i happen to know hes flying out
to the coast this evening because im the one has to pick him up and take him
to the airport 
ok, said tricia, im ready  its the big limo out the front 
tricia turned back to gail  im sorry, she said 
go! go! said gail  ive enjoyed meeting you 
tricia made to reach for her bag for some cash 
drinks are on me, insisted gail 
tricia sighed 
look, im really sorry about this morning and 
dont say another word  im fine  its only astrology  on an impulse tricia gave her a hug  you dont want to pick up your
bag or anything?
if theres one thing that lifes taught me, said tricia, its never go back for
your bag 

just a little over an hour later, tricia sat on one of the pair of beds in her
hotel room  for a few minutes she didnt move 
in her hand was a note from gail andrews, saying, dont be too disappointed  if i were you id stay in at home tomorrow
night  but dont mind me, and dont worry  its only astrology  gail 
in fact the chauffeur seemed to know
more about what was going on inside nbs than any other single person she
had encountered in the organisation  martin had been keen, zwingler had not  time to phone the airline and see if she could still get the
red-eye back to heathrow 

either the script or the autocue 



the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy has, in what we laughingly call the
past, had a great deal to say on the subject of parallel universes  very little of
this is, however, at all comprehensible to anyone below the level of advanced
god, and since it is now well-established that all known gods came into ex-
istence a good three millionths of a second after the universe began rather
than, as they usually claimed, the previous week, they already have a great
deal of explaining to do as it is, and are therefore not available for comment
on matters of deep physics at this time 
one encouraging thing the guide does have to say on the subject of parallel
universes is that you dont stand the remotest chance of understanding it  you
can therefore say what? and eh? and even go cross-eyed and start to
blither if you like without any fear of making a fool of yourself 
the first thing to realise about parallel universes, the guide says, is that they
are not parallel 
it is also important to realise that they are not, strictly speaking, universes
either, but it is easiest if you try and realise that a little later, after youve
realised that everything youve realised up to that moment is not true 
the reason they are not universes is that any given universe is not actually a
thing as such, but is just a way of looking at what is technically known as the
wsogmm, or whole sort of general mish mash  the whole sort of general
mish mash doesnt actually exist either, but is just the sum total of all the
different ways there would be of looking at it if it did 
it doesnt mean anything  you can slice the whole sort of general mish mash
any way you like and you will generally come up with something that someone
will call home 
please feel free to blither now 

the earth with which we are here concerned, because of its particular ori-
entation in the whole sort of general mish mash, was hit by a neutrino that
other earths were not 
a neutrino is not a big thing to be hit by 
in fact its hard to think of anything much smaller by which one could rea-
sonably hope to be hit  and its not as if being hit by neutrinos was in itself
a particularly unusual event for something the size of the earth 
it would be an unusual nanosecond in which the earth was not hit by several
billion passing neutrinos  the chances of a neutrino actually hitting
something as it travels through all this howling emptiness are roughly compa-
rable to that of dropping a ball bearing at random from a cruising 747 and
hitting, say, an egg sandwich 
anyway, this neutrino hit something  nothing terribly impor- tant in the
scale of things, you might say  but the problem with saying something like
that is that you would be talking cross- eyed badger spit  once something ac-
tually happens somewhere in something as wildly complicated as the universe,
kevin knows where it will all end up - where kevin is any random entity
that doesnt know nothin about nothin 
this neutrino struck an atom  or what would, after a lot of palaver and local difficulties of a
geological nature, become essex  the pre-
cise causal connection between this tiny biological happenstance, and a few
other minor vari- ations that exist in that slice of the whole sort of general
mish mash - such as tricia mcmillan failing to leave with zaphod beeblebrox,
abnormally low sales of pecan-flavoured ice-cream and the fact that the earth
on which all this occurred did not get demolished by the vogons to make way
for a new hyperspace bypass - is currently sitting at number 4,763,984,132 on
the research project priority list at what was once the history department of
the university of maximegalon, and no one cur- rently at the prayer meeting
by the poolside appears to feel any sense of urgency about the problem 



tricia began to feel that the world was conspiring against her 
she didnt really care about marks on her lawn very much  she had just got home from new york feeling tired, crabby and
paranoid, and all she wanted to do was go to bed with the radio on quietly and
gradually fall asleep to the sound of ned sherrin being terribly clever about
something 
but eric bartlett was not going to let her get away with not making a thor-
ough inspection of the marks  he
didnt believe in people coming in from new york first thing in the morning 
didnt hold with it 
probably them space aliens, he said, bending over and prod- ding at the
edges of the small indentations with his stick  ten minutes, she reck-
oned  one? - it got abducted by space aliens  course, they28

chapter 4 
i see, said tricia 
you dont think its the lawn mower? asked tricia 
if the marks were more round, id say, but these are just off-round, you see 
its just that you mentioned the lawn mower was playing up and needed fixing
or it might start gouging holes in the lawn  im not saying its
not the lawn mower for definite, im just saying what seems to me more likely
given the shapes of the holes 
thank you, eric, said tricia  im going to bed now, in fact  if i were
you, though, id watch for signs of alien activity in the area  particularly from over there in the henley direction 
thank you, eric, said tricia again  she spent at least an hour
dithering, trying to make up her mind whether to head up into town and go
to stavros for the evening  she was very fond of stavro himself, who was a greek with
a german father - a fairly odd combination  tricia had been to the alpha a
couple of nights earlier, which was stavros original club in new york, now

29

run by his brother karl, who thought of himself as a german with a greek
mother  stavro would be very happy to be told that karl was making a bit of
a pigs ear of running the new york club, so tricia would go and make him
happy  there was little love lost between stavro and karl mueller  thats what she would do 
she then spent another hour dithering about what to wear  you
get one of those trolleys which simply will not go in the direction you push
it and end up just having to buy completely different stuff  what do you do
with it? what do you do with the recipe? she didnt know 



she watched it coming in from over the henley direction with mild curiosity
at first, wondering what those lights were 
when whatever it was began to come closer and closer her curiosity began to
turn to bemusement 
she was still feeling dopey and jet-lagged and the messages that one part of
her brain was busy sending to another were not necessarily arriving on time or
the right way up  she didnt notice the scalding
coffee slopping over her foot  she was hardly breathing as slowly, inch by
inch, foot by foot, the craft came downwards  it didnt look exactly like the one she
had seen departing all those years ago, she thought, but flashing lights in the
night sky are hard to resolve into clear shapes 
mcmillan? a voice said at last, a strange, thin voice that managed the syl-
lables with difficulty  tricia mcmillan  ms tricia mcmillan?
yes, said tricia, almost soundlessly 
what? said tricia 
i dont understand, said tricia  she hadnt expected any of this, of
course, but even for something she hadnt expected to begin with it wasnt
going the way she expected 
they conferred with each other in some skittering language of their own and
then turned back to her 
we dont think so  i dont know, said tricia, helplessly 
is it far from here? which direction? we dont know 
tricia realised with a sinking heart that they had no idea who she was talking
about  she had to
wake up to the fact that she had here the journalistic scoop of the cen- tury 
what should she do? go back into the house for a video camera? wouldnt
they just be gone when she got back? she was thoroughly confused as to
strategy  keepem talking, she thought 
youve been monitoring 
tricia stared at them 

33

that must be very boring, isnt it? she blurted out 
there was a terribly long silence as tricia looked at the aliens and the aliens
looked at her 
theres something i would just like to get from indoors, said tricia very
deliberately 

all three of them stood, slightly awkwardly in her sitting room, as she
hurried around picking up a video camera, a 35mm camera, a tape recorder,
every recording medium she could grab hold of  they were all thin and, under
domestic lighting conditions, a sort of dim purplish green 
i really wont be a second, guys, tricia said, as she rummaged through some
drawers for spare tapes and films 
the aliens were looking at the shelves that held her cds and her old records 
tricia stopped, and stared at them all over again 
what? said tricia 
are you telling me that you have kidnapped elvis? gasped tricia 
i must get this down, tricia muttered to herself  she didnt

34

chapter 5 

put it up to her eye because she didnt want to freak them out  whats your name?
i dont know 
you dont know 
i see, said tricia  and what about you other two?
we dont know 
you dont know where youre from?
they shook their heads again 
so, said tricia  er 
excuse me, said tricia, im going to have to get a tripod 
they seemed happy enough to stand there doing nothing while tricia quickly
found a tripod and mounted the camera on it 
we liked your interview with the astrologer  we are very interested in astrology  astrology is interesting 
tricia didnt know where to start  theres no point in trying to second guess any of this
stuff 
so she said, but i dont know anything about astrology  we follow our horoscopes 
whats his name?
we do not know 
what does he say his name is, for christs sake? sorry ill need to edit that 
so how do you all know hes the leader?
he seized control  where is here?
rupert 
what?
your people call it rupert 
ok, said tricia  what is the problem that your leader says you
have?
triangulation 
i beg your pardon?
astrology is a very precise science  amongst the things we have forgotten, which
we think are many and profound, is trigonometry 

let me get this straight, said tricia 
rupert 
to recalculate your horoscopes for you to take account of the relative posi-
tions of earth and rupert?
yes 
im your girl, said tricia, thinking that at the very least she could sell it to
the national enquirer 

as she boarded the craft that would take her off to the furthest limits
of the solar system, the first thing that met her eyes was a bank of video
monitors across which thousands of images were sweeping  it was a replay of the impromptu interview which tricia had
just conducted with his three colleagues  he looked up when he saw her ap-
prehensively climbing in 



ford prefect hit the ground running  damn! he ran off down the corridor any-
way, hobbling slightly 
all over the building, alarms were erupting into their usual frenzy of excite-
ment  he dived for cover behind the usual storage cabinets, glanced around to
check that he was unseen, and started rapidly to fish around inside his satchel
for the usual things he needed 
the ground was not only three inches further from the ven- tilation shaft than
he remembered, it was also on a different planet than he remembered, but it
was the three inches that had caught him by surprise  the offices of the hitch
hikers guide to the galaxy were quite often shifted at very short notice to
another planet, for reasons of local climate, local hostility, power bills or tax,
but they were always reconstructed exactly the same way, almost to the very
molecule  for many of the companys employees, the layout of their offices
represented the only constant they knew in a severely distorted personal uni-
verse  he couldnt quite get it
into focus immediately 3 gauge prising tool  the world outside had been38

chapter 6  he had not been to saquo-pilia hensha before, and he
had liked it 
he took from his satchel a toy bow and arrow which he had bought in a street
market 
he had discovered that the reason for the carnival atmosphere on saquo-pilia
hensha was that the local people were celebrating the annual feast of the as-
sumption of st antwelm  st antwelm had been, during his lifetime, a great
and popular king who had made a great and popular assumption  what king
antwelm had assumed was that what everybody wanted, all other things be-
ing equal, was to be happy and enjoy themselves and have the best possible
time together  on his death he had willed his entire per- sonal fortune to
financing an annual festival to remind everyone of this, with lots of good food
and dancing and very silly games like hunt the wocket 
the familiar h-shaped building of the hitch hikers guide offices rose above
the outskirts of the city, and ford prefect had broken into it in the famil-
iar way  ford prefects expense ac-
counts were notoriously complex and difficult affairs and he had found, on the
whole, that the lobby robots were ill-equipped to understand the arguments
he wished to put forward in relation to them 
because of the various sensory protuberances with which the robot was fes-
tooned, it couldnt manoeuvre inside the towel, and it just twitched back and
forth without being able to turn and face its captor 3 gauge prising tool and flipped off the
small plastic panel on top of the robot which gave access to its logic circuits 
now logic is a wonderful thing but it has, as the processes of evolution discov-
ered, certain drawbacks  this was best demonstrated by the famous herring sand-
wich experiments conducted millennia ago at mispwoso (the maximegalon
institute of slowly and painfully working out the surprisingly obvious) 
it would then bend over and scoop up the herring sandwich in its herring sand-
wich scoop, and then straighten up again , etc 
the scientists at the institute thus discovered the driving force behind all
change, development and innovation in life, which was this: herring sand-
wiches  they published a paper to this effect, which was widely criticised as
being extremely stupid  they checked their figures and realised that what
they had actually discovered was boredom, or rather, the practical function
of boredom 
in a fever of excitement they then went on to discover other
emotions, like irritability, depression, reluctance, ickiness and so on 
vast wodges of complex computer code governing robot behav- iour in all pos-
sible contingencies could be replaced very simply  it was particularly happy when it could see other
things moving about, particularly if the other things were moving about do-
ing things they shouldnt do because it could then, with considerable delight,
report them  the robot was whirring grungily and pettishly, but it could only
fidget, it couldnt actually move  using the prising tool, ford eased a small
chip out from its socket  as soon as it came out, the robot went quiet and just
sat there in a coma  the robot rose ecstatically
into the air, pursuing a kind of wriggly path 
mr prefect, sir! im so happy to see you!
good to see you, little fella, said ford 
the robot rapidly reported back to its central control that everything was
now for the best in this best of all possible worlds, the alarms rapidly quelled
themselves, and life returned to normal 
the little robot was gurgling with electric delight  ford hurried on down the
corridor, letting the thing bob along in his wake telling him how delicious ev-
erything was, and how happy it was to be able to tell him that 
he passed faces of people he didnt know  they didnt look like his sort of
people  every time
he thought he saw someone he recognised in the distance, and hurried along
to say hello, it would turn out to be someone else, with an altogether neater
hairstyle and a much more thrusting, purposeful look than, well, than anybody
ford knew  a lobby had been remodelled  all these things were not worrying in
themselves, though they were a little disorienting  it used to be brash and glitzy  expensive - because the guide
sold so well through the civilised and post-civilised galaxy - but expensive and
fun  insanely painted grand pianos
hung from ceilings, vicious sea creatures from the planet viv reared up out of
pools in tree-filled atria, robot butlers in stupid shirts roamed the corridors
seeking whose hands they might press frothing drinks into  people used to
have pet vastdragons on leads and pterospondes on perches in their offices 
people knew how to have a good time, and if they didnt there were courses
they could sign up for which would put that right  he squatted down and peered at the burbling cybernaut 
whats been happening here? he demanded  it was overjoyed to be spurned in
this way and started to bob and burble and swoon  it tried to stay where it
was put but couldnt help quivering slightly 
somethings changed, hasnt it? ford hissed 
just tell me whats happened!
oh thank you, thank you!
ford sighed  theres a new
management  the old management was
also fabulous of course, though im not sure if i thought so at the time  how wonderfully, bub- blingly, frothingly,
burstingly true  what a truly ecstasy-induc- ingly correct observation 
whats happened? insisted ford 

ford hurled himself at the door of the editor-in-chiefs office, tucked him-
self into a tight ball as the frame splintered and gave way, rolled rapidly across
the floor to where the drinks trolley laden with some of the galaxys most
potent and expen- sive beverages habitually stood, seized hold of the trolley
and, using it to give himself cover, trundled it and himself across the main ex-
posed part of the office floor to where the valuable and extremely rude statue
of leda and the octopus stood, and took shelter behind it  meanwhile the
little security robot, entering at chest height, was suicidally delighted to draw
gunfire away from ford  the current editor-in-chief,
stagyar-zil-doggo, was a dangerously unbalanced man who took a homici-
dal view of contributing staff turning up in his office without pages of fresh,
proofed copy, and had a battery of laser guided guns linked to special scanning
devices in the door frame to deter anybody who was merely bringing extremely
good reasons why they hadnt written any 
unfortunately the drinks trolley wasnt there 
ford hurled himself desperately sideways and somersaulted towards the statue
of leda and the octopus, which also wasnt there  he rolled and hurtled
around the room in a kind of random panic, tripped, span, hit the window,
which fortunately was built to withstand rocket attacks, rebounded, and fell
in a bruised and winded heap behind a smart grey crushed leather sofa, which
hadnt been there before  as well
as there being no drinks trolley and no leda and the octopus, there had also
been a startling absence of gunfire 
mr prefect, i assume, said a voice  he was
sitting with his elbows resting on the table and holding his fingertips together
in a manner which, inexplicably, has never been made a capital offence 
ive been busy, said ford, rather weakly 
my name is vann harl  he didnt put his hand out  he just added, what
have you done to that security robot?
the little robot was rolling very, very slowly round the ceiling and moaning
quietly to itself 
ive made it very happy, snapped ford 
wheres stagyar? more to the point, wheres his drinks trolley?
mr zil-doggo is no longer with this organisation  his drinks trolley is, i imag-
ine, helping to console him for this fact 
no, said harl  me harl  you prefect 
siddown, prefect, said harl 
we at infinidim enterprises are 
you at what?
infinidim enterprises 
infinidim?
we spent millions on that name, prefect 
the galaxy is changing, said harl  weve got to change with it 
dont tell me about the future, said ford  ive been all over the future  anywhen else  just the same old stuff in faster cars and smellier air 
thats one future, said harl  thats your future, if you accept it  youve
got to learn to think multi-dimensionally  there are limitless futures stretch-
ing out in every direction from this moment - and from this moment and from
this  billions of them, bifurcating every instant! every possible position of
every possible electron balloons out into billions of probabilities! bil- lions
and billions of shining, gleaming futures! you know what that means?
youre dribbling down your chin 
the reason we dont sell billions and billions of guides, continued harl, after
wiping his mouth, is the expense  and we dont sell to penniless hitch hik-
ers  what a stupid notion that was! find the one section of the market that,
more or less by definition, doesnt have any money, and try and sell to it 
we sell to the affluent business traveller and his vacationing wife in a billion,
billion different futures   this is the most radical, dynamic and thrusting busi-
ness venture in the entire multidimensional infinity of space/time/probability
ever 
the towel leapt up out of harls hands 
this was not because it had any motive force of its own, but because harl was

45

so startled at the idea that it might  the next thing that startled him was the
sight of ford prefect hurtling across the desk at him fists first  in fact ford
was just lunging for the credit card, but you dont get to occupy the sort of
position that harl occupied in the sort of organisation in which harl occupied
it without developing a healthily paranoid view of life 
ford lay on the desk, surprised at how swimmingly every- thing had gone  he
glanced quickly at the piece of plastic he now held in his hand - it was a dine-
o-charge credit card with his name already embossed on it, and an expiry
date two years from now, and was possibly the single most exciting thing ford
had ever seen in his life - then he clambered over the desk to see to harl  it occurred to ford that he might breathe more
easily yet without the weight of his wallet bearing down on his chest, so he
slipped it out of harls breast pocket and flipped through it  ultragolf club membership 
photos of someones wife and family - presumably harls, but it was hard to
be sure these days  busy executives often didnt have time for a full-time wife
and family and would just rent them for weekends 
ha!
he couldnt believe what hed just found 
he slowly drew out from the wallet a single and insanely exciting piece of plas-
tic that was nestling amongst a bunch of receipts 
it wasnt insanely exciting to look at  if you held it up
to the light you could see a lot of holographically encoded information and
images buried pseudo-inches deep beneath its surface  
it was an ident-i-eeze, and was a very naughty and silly thing for harl to have
lying around in his wallet, though it was perfectly understandable  there were
so many different ways in which you were required to provide absolute proof
of your iden- tity these days that life could easily become extremely tiresome
just from that factor alone, never mind the deeper existential problems of try-
ing to function as a coherent consciousness in an epistemologically ambiguous
physical universe  queues of
people standing around waiting to have their fingerprints read, their retinas
scanned, bits of skin scraped from the nape of the neck and undergoing in-
stant (or nearly instant - a good six or seven seconds in tedious reality) genetic
analysis, then having to answer trick questions about members of their family
they didnt even remember they had, and about their recorded preferences

46

chapter 6 

for tablecloth colours  this encoded every single piece of information about
you, your body and your life into one all- purpose machine-readable card that
you could then carry around in your wallet, and therefore represented technol-
ogys greatest triumph to date over both itself and plain common sense  he won-
dered how long harl would remain unconscious 
hey! he shouted to the little melon-sized robot still slobbering with euphoria
up on the ceiling  you want to stay happy?
the robot gurgled that it did  it had never realised before how much sheer titillation there
was to be got from a good ceiling and it wanted to explore its feelings about
ceilings in greater depth 
you stay there, said ford, and youll soon be recaptured and have your
conditional chip replaced 
the robot let out a long heartfelt sigh of impassioned tristesse and sank reluc-
tantly away from the ceiling 
dont give it any information  just make it feel good so it doesnt feel the
need to ask for any  it showed every sign now of becoming extremely froody 



arthur dent had been in some hell-holes in his life, but he had never be-
fore seen a spaceport which had a sign saying, even travelling despondently
is better than arriving here  it was the only picture anybody
could find of him, and it had been taken shortly after he had shot himself so
although the photo had been retouched as well as could be managed the smile
it wore was rather a ghastly one  the side of his head had been drawn back
in in crayon  it said that the planet of nowwhat had been
named after the open- ing words of the first settlers to arrive there after strug-
gling across light years of space to reach the furthest unexplored outreaches
of the galaxy  the main town was called ohwell  there werent any other
towns to speak of  settlement on nowwhat had not been a success and the
sort of people who actually wanted to live on nowwhat were not the sort of
people you would want to spend time with  the main trade that was carried out
was in the skins of the nowwhattian boghog but it wasnt a very successful
one because no one in their right minds would want to buy a nowwhattian
boghog skin  whoever had writ-
ten it had obviously started out trying to drum up a little enthusiasm for the48

chapter 7 

place by stressing that it wasnt actually cold and wet all the time, but could
find little positive to add to this so the tone of the piece quickly degenerated
into savage irony  it said that the major activities
pursued on nowwhat were those of catching, skinning and eating nowwhat-
tian boghogs, which were the only extant form of animal life on nowwhat,
all other having long ago died of despair  the boghogs were tiny, vicious
creatures, and the small margin by which they fell short of being completely
inedible was the margin by which life on the planet subsisted  so what were
the rewards, however small, that made life on nowwhat worth living? well,
there werent any  even making yourself some protective clothing
out of boghog skins was an exercise in disappointment and futility, since the
skins were unaccountably thin and leaky  this caused a lot of puzzled con-
jecture amongst the settlers  what was the boghogs secret of keeping warm?
if anyone had ever learnt the language the boghogs spoke to each other they
would have discovered that there was no trick  the boghogs were as cold and
wet as anyone else on the planet  no one had had the slightest desire to learn
the language of the boghogs for the simple reason that these creatures commu-
nicated by biting each other very hard on the thigh  life on nowwhat being
what it was, most of what a boghog might have to say about it could easily
be signified by these means  they were fairly rough and
ready because they werent likely to be of much interest to anyone, but they
told him what he wanted to know 
he didnt recognise it at first because the maps were the other way up from
the way he would have expected and looked, therefore thoroughly unfamiliar 
there was one huge landmass off on the upper left-hand side of the page which
tapered down to a tiny waist and then ballooned out again like a large comma 
on the right-hand side was a collection of large shapes jumbled familiarly to-
gether  the outlines were not exactly the same, and arthur didnt know if
this was because the map was so rough, or because the sea-level was higher or
because, well, things were just different here  but the evidence was inarguable  what co-ordinates it occupied in probability was anybodys guess  a year since the accident
in hyperspace in which fenchurch had completely vanished  one minute she
had been sitting there next to him in the slumpjet; the next minute the ship
had done a perfectly normal hyperspace hop and when he had next looked
she was not there  the seat wasnt even warm  her name wasnt even on the
passenger list 
the spaceline had been wary of him when he had complained  but when they had asked him what galactic sector he and fenchurch
had been from and he had said zz9 plural z alpha they had relaxed completely
in a way that arthur wasnt at all sure he liked  they pointed to the clause in the ticket
contract which said that the entities whose lifespans had originated in any of
the plural zones were advised not to travel in hyperspace and did so at their
own risk  they tittered slightly and shook
their heads  not only
had he lost fenchurch in the most complete and utter way possible, but he felt
that the more time he spent away out in the galaxy the more it seemed that
the number of things he didnt know anything about actually increased  a fat and dishevelled
man came in carrying arthurs one small case 
he got as far as, where shall i put - when there was a sudden violent flurry
and he collapsed heavily against the door, trying to beat off a small and mangy
creature that had leapt snarling out of the wet night and buried its teeth in his
thigh, even through the thick layers of leather padding he wore there  there
was a brief, ugly confusion of jabbering and thrash- ing  arthur grabbed a hefty stick that stood next to the
door expressly for this purpose and beat at the boghog with it 
the boghog suddenly disengaged and limped backwards, dazed and forlorn 

wardly and repeatedly to one side  by the door, the fat man
with arthurs suitcase was sitting and cursing, trying to staunch the flow of
blood from his thigh  the boghog looked at
him questioningly  it tried to approach him, waking mournful little whimper-
ing noises  it made a sudden leap for arthurs
thigh, but its dislocated jaw was too weak to get a grip and it sank, whining
sadly, down to the floor  the fat man jumped to his feet, grabbed the stick,
beat the boghogs brains into a sticky, pulpy mess on the thin carpet, and then
stood there breathing heavily as if daring the animal to move again, just once 
a single boghog eyeball sat looking reproachfully at arthur from out of the
mashed ruins of its head 
whens the next flight out? asked arthur 
thought youd only just arrived, said the man 
you mean youre on the wrong planet? said the man lugu- briously  he eyed the
remains of the boghog with a deep, ancestral resentment 
a single bird wheeled in the sky above him as he set off back for the spaceport  it wasnt much of one, but it was his and he
stuck by it, more or less 
he wasnt sure if that counted as an ethic, but you have to go with what youve
got 
if his accounts supervisor didnt start to hyperventilate and put out a seal-all-
exits security alert when ford handed in his expenses claim then ford felt he
wasnt doing his job properly  sucking very hard on it, even nibbling it
in an affectionate kind of a way was ok, but you didnt actually bite it 
but that, thought ford as he ducked and weaved his way down through the
building, was about to change  lines of neat grey office cubicles and executive workstation
pods  out in the street they were
playing hunt the wocket for zarks sake, but here in the very heart of the
guide offices no one was even recklessly kicking a ball around the corridors or
wearing inappropriately coloured beachware 
infinidim enterprises, ford snarled to himself as he stalked rapidly down
one corridor after another  door after door magi- cally opened to him without
question  elevators took him happily to places they should not  his happy little robot took care
of everything, spreading waves of acquiescent joy through all the security cir-
cuits it encountered 

ford thought it needed a name and decided to call it emily saunders, after a
girl he had very fond memories of  then he thought that emily saunders was
an absurd name for a security robot, and decided to call it colin instead, after
emilys dog  he was beginning to
encounter puzzled looks from the operatives he passed  at this level of secu-
rity you didnt even call them people anymore  and they were probably doing
stuff that only operatives would do 
the truth of the matter was that all sorts of highly dodgy stuff went on behind
the cheery, happy-go-lucky front that the guide liked to put up - or used to
like to put up before this new infinidim enterprises bunch marched in and
started to make the whole thing highly dodgy  there were all kinds of tax
scams and rackets and graft and shady deals supporting the shining edifice,
and down in the secure research and data-processing levels of the building was
where it all went on 
every few years the guide would set up its business, and indeed its building
on a new world, and all would be sunshine and laughter for a while as the
guide would put down its roots in the local culture and economy, provide
employment, a sense of glamour and adventure and, in the end, not quite as
much actual revenue as the locals had expected  whole cultures and economies would
collapse in its wake, often within a week, leaving once thriving planets desolate
and shell-shocked but still somehow feeling they had been part of some great
adven- ture 
the operatives who shot puzzled glances at ford as he marched on into the
depths of the buildings most sensitive areas were reassured by the presence of
colin, who was flying along with him in a buzz of emotional fulfilment and
easing his path for him at every stage  perhaps that
meant that vann harl had already been discovered, which might be a problem  well, that was a problem for later, and he didnt

53

for the moment have the faintest idea how he was going to solve it  for the
moment he wasnt going to worry  wherever he went with little colin, he was
surrounded by a cocoon of sweetness and light and, most importantly, willing
and acquiescent elevators and positively obsequious doors 
the next door wouldnt open  it stood there before him, grey and resolutely closed with a sign on it
saying:

not even to authorised personnel 

colin reported that the doors had been getting generally a lot grimmer

down in these lower reaches of the building  colins rampant euphoria had subsided into a kind of determined
cheeriness  it was taking all his
energy to pump the slightest bonhomie whatsoever into the doors down here 
he walked in and colin flew in after him 
the computer terminals that lined the grey walls were win- dows on to every
aspect of the guides operations  the remaining copy would then be shot across to the
other half of the building - the other leg of the h - which was the legal de-
partment  the legal department would cut out anything that was still even
remotely good from what remained and fire it back to the offices of the ex-
ecutive editors, who were also out at lunch 
when any of the editors finally staggered in from lunch they would exclaim
what is this feeble crap that x - where x was the name of the field re-
searcher in question - has sent us from half-way across the bloody galaxy?
whats the point of having somebody spending three whole orbital periods
out in the bloody gagrakacka mind zones, with all that stuff going on out
there, if this load of anaemic squitter is the best he can be bothered to send
us  disallow his expenses!
what shall we do with the copy? the secretary would ask  ive
got a headache, im going home 
meanwhile the order to disallow the researchers expenses was relayed down
to the computer terminal stuck off in the right-hand corner, and it was to this
terminal that ford prefect now swiftly made his way  there is an awful lot of stuff you dont know anything
about, but you are not alone in this  its just that in your case the consequences
of not knowing any of this stuff are particularly terrible, but then, hey, thats
just the way the cookie gets completely stomped on and obliterated 
b) dont imagine you know what a computer terminal is 
a computer terminal is not some clunky old television with a typewriter in
front of it 
it wasnt the normal universe he knew 
it was a universe of densely en-
folded worlds, of wild topographies, towering moun- tain peaks, heart stop-
ping ravines, of moons shattering off into sea horses, hurtful blurting crevices,
silently heaving oceans and bottomless hurtling hooping funts 
he didnt know his way around this universe  he didnt even know the physical

55

laws that determined its dimensional extents or behaviours, but his instinct
told him to look for the most outstanding feature he could detect and make
towards it 
way off in some indistinguishable distance - was it a mile or a million or a mote
in his eye? - was a stunning peak that overarched the sky, climbed and climbed
and spread out in flowering aigrettes 1, agglomerates 2, and arch imandrites
3 
he weltered towards it, hooling and thurling, and at last reached it in a mean-
inglessly long umthingth of time 
he clung to it, arms outspread, gripping tightly on to its roughly gnarled and
pitted surface 
while he had been weltering, hooling and thurling, the distance beneath him
had not bothered him unduly, but now that he was

1 an ornamental tuft of plumes  his eyes turned inwards with waves from the
willowing extremities of nausea 
before long, insofar as such terms had any meaning in this virtual universe,
a ledge loomed up ahead of him on which he could grip and on to which he
could clamber  he wasnt certain if this was to
prevent himself from falling down off it or rising up from it, but he needed
something to grip on to as he surveyed the world in which he found himself  he told himself
repeatedly that he was just in a graphic rep- resentation of a world 
he was sitting in a blue leatherette foam filled swivel-seated office chair in
front of a computer terminal 
it wasnt just the landscape being so far beneath him - he wished it would stop
undulating and waving 
he was in a four-dimensional topological model of the guides financial sys-
tems, and somebody or something would very shortly want to know why 
swooping through virtual space towards him came a small flock of mean and
steely-eyed creatures with pointy little heads, pencil moustaches and querulous
demands as to who he was, what he was doing there, what his authorisation
was, what the authorisation of his authorising agent was, what his inside leg
measurement was and so on  laser light flickered all over him as if he was
a packet of biscuits at a supermarket check-out  the heavier duty laser guns
were held, for the moment, in reserve  being virtually killed by a virtual laser in
virtual space is just as effective as the real thing, because you are as dead as
you think you are 
the laser readers were becoming very agitated as they flickered over his fingerprints,
his retina and the follicle pattern where his hair line was receding  they didnt
like what they were finding at all  the chattering and screeching of highly per-
sonal and insolent questions was rising in pitch  a little surgical steel scraper
was reaching out towards the skin at the nape of his neck when ford, holding
his breath and praying very slightly, pulled vann harls ident-i-eeze out of his
pocket and waved it in front of them 
instantly every laser was diverted to the little card and swept backwards and
forwards over it and in it, examining and reading every molecule 
the entire flock of little virtual inspectors snapped to attention 

57

nice to see you, mr harl, they said in smarmy unison  he could have transferred ownership of the entire organisation into
his own name, but he doubted if that would have gone unnoticed  he didnt
want it anyway 
it had to want not to know about what ford was up to, and then he could safely
leave the computer to rationalise its own defences against the information ever
emerging  it was a pro- gramming technique that had been reverse-engineered
from the sort of psychotic mental blocks that otherwise perfectly normal people
had been observed invariably to develop when elected to high political office 
he would never have discovered it if he hadnt been busy engineering a mental
block himself  he came across a whole slew of smooth and plausible denial
procedures and diversionary subroutines exactly where he had been planning
to install his own  the computer denied all knowledge of them, of course, then
blankly refused to accept that there was anything even to deny knowledge of,
and was generally so convincing that even ford almost found himself thinking
he must have made a mistake 
he was so impressed, in fact, that he didnt bother to install his own mental
block procedures, he just set up calls to the ones that were already there, which
then called themselves when ques- tioned, and so on 
he quickly set about debugging the little bits of code he had installed himself,
only to discover they werent there 
he was just about to start installing them all over again when he realised that
the reason he couldnt find them was that they were working already  ford took the elevator up to the ground floor to change to the
express elevators  he had somehow to get the ident-i-eeze back into harls
pocket before it was missed  how, he didnt know 
this was fun, thought ford, giving colin a friendly pat  colin was about the
first genuinely useful robot ford had ever encountered  colin bobbed along
in the air in front of him in a lather of cheerful ecstasy  ford was glad hed
named him after a dog 
he was highly tempted just to leave at that point and hope for the best, but
he knew that the best had a far greater chance of actually occurring if harl
did not discover that his ident-i-eeze was missing 
they went to the express elevators  the elevator lit
up the twenty-third floor on its floor display and started to zoom upwards 
something about the floor display tweaked at fords mind but he couldnt
catch what it was and forgot about it  he hadnt really thought
through how he was going to deal with whatever it was that was happening
up there because he had no idea what he was going to find  he would just
have to busk it 
there was the door to harls office, with a slight layer of dust around it  ford
knew that this dust consisted of billions of tiny molecular robots that had
crawled out of the woodwork, built each other, rebuilt the door , disassembled
each other and then crept back into the woodwork again and just waited for
damage  there was a whole galaxy of stuff out there for
him, and he wondered if it was churlish of him to complain to himself that it
lacked just two things: the world he was born on and the woman he loved  he consulted the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy  he looked up advice and it
said see under guid- ance 
however it appeared that some sort of calamity had befallen this planet 
no call for us any more, he said gruffly as he started to bang a nail into the
plank he was holding across the window of his hovel 
oh? whys that?
hold on to the other end of this and ill show you 
arthur held up the unnailed end of the plank and the old prophet scuttled
into the recesses of his hovel, returning a moment or two later with a small
sub-etha radio  he turned it on, fiddled with the dial for a moment and put
the thing on the small wooden bench that he usually sat and prophesied on 
he then took hold of the plank again and resumed hammering 
tomorrow, it continued, the vice-president of poffla vigus, roopy ga
stip, will announce that he intends to run for presi- dent  arthur pushed the preset button  next weeks jobless totals in the
zabush sector, it continued, will be the worst since records began 
find another, barked the prophet, crossly  next months royal wedding be-
tween prince gid of the soofling dynasty and princess hooli of raui alpha
will be the most spectacular ceremony the bjanjy territories has ever wit-
nessed  our reporter trillian astra is there and sends us this report  a very familiar voice said, well krart, the scene here in the middle of
next month is absolutely incred- ible  princess hooli is looking radiant in a 
the prophet swiped the radio off the bench and on to the dusty ground, where
it squawked like a badly tuned chicken 
i was listening to that, complained arthur, grappling help- lessly with the
prophets hammer  thats why this place is like a ghost town 
princess hooli? if i had to stand around saying hello to everybody whos
known princess hooli id need a new set of lungs  her names trillian  i dont
know where she got the astra from  shes from the same planet as me 
oh, shes all over the continuum these days  we cant get the tri-d tv sta-
tions out here of course, thank the great green arkleseizure, but you hear her
on the radio, gallivanting here and there through space/time  itll all end in
tears 

the village of oracles wasnt much better  there was a sign by the
entrance saying, i just dont know any more  try next door, but thats just
a suggestion, not formal oracular advice  the
distended bladders of some of the local goat-like things were hanging from a
propped-up line drying in the sun, and the smell could have been coming from
them  there was also, a worryingly small distance away, a pile of discarded
bodies of the local goat-like things and the smell could have been coming from
them  every now and then, by chance,
her wild thrashing would connect with one of the flies with a richly satisfying
thunk, and the fly would hurtle through the air and smack itself open against
the rock face a few yards from the entrance to her cave  the gentle
cough, courteously meant, unfortunately involved first inhaling rather more of
the local atmosphere than he had so far been doing and as a result, he erupted
into a fit of raucous expectoration, and collapsed against the rock face, chok-
ing and streaming with tears  he vomited, half-choked again, rolled over his vomit, kept
rolling for a few yards, and eventually made it up on to his hands and knees
and crawled, panting, into slightly fresher air  he gestured helplessly towards the small
pile of his own vomit lying spread around the entrance to her cave  she looked round at him suspiciously,
but, being half blind, had difficulty finding him in the blurred and rocky land-
scape 
at last she spotted him, grunted to herself and turned back to whacking flies  the drying bladders,
the festering bodies and the noxious potage may all have been making violent
contributions to the atmosphere, but the major olfactory presence was the
woman herself 
unsteadily, arthur got to his feet and brushed himself down with a fistful of
dried grass  he didnt know what else to do by way of announcing himself  he
had half a mind just to wander off again, but felt awkward about leaving a
pile of his vomit in front of the entrance to the womans home  he started to pluck up more handsful of the scrubby
dried grass that was to be found here and there  he was worried, though, that
if he ventured nearer to the vomit he might simply add to it rather than clear
it up 
just as he was debating with himself as to what the right course of action was
he began to realise that she was at last saying something to him 
arthur fished the crumpled-up brochure from his pocket  he wasnt quite cer-
tain why  he had already read it and she, he expected, wouldnt want to  the copy in the brochure wittered on about the ancient
mystical arts of the seers and sages of hawalius, and wild- ly over-represented
the level of accommodation available in hawalion  arthur still carried a copy
of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy with him but found, when he con-
sulted it, that the entries were becoming more abstruse and paranoid and had
lots of xs and js and s in them  whether
it was in his own personal unit, or whether it was something or someone going

65

terribly amiss, or perhaps just hallucinating, at the heart of the guide organi-
sation itself, he didnt know  yes, that is -
he frowned again at the brochure, as if to be certain that he hadnt misread it
and stupidly turned up on the wrong planet or something  bit of a problem i sometimes find
if im being perfectly honest  he was trying desperately, with tiny darting
movements, to stay upwind of her 
youll have to help me with the photocopier, then, she said  youll have to help me drag it
out  i have to keep it in the cave, though, so the birds
dont shit on it 
id take a few deep breaths if i were you, muttered the old woman, as she
stomped into the gloom of the cave mouth  he almost hyperventilated in fact 
the photocopier was a big old thing on a rickety trolley  the wheels were stuck obstinately in different
directions and the ground was rough and stony  if she wasnt going to be embarrassed about it then nei-
ther, he was determined, would he 
itll take a while, she said 
ive eaten, thanks, said arthur  ive eaten 
im sure you have, said the old lady  after a few
minutes she fished a lump of some- thing out, blew on it to cool it a little, and
then put it in her mouth 
together they disengaged the tin from the tripod and carried it awkwardly
down the slight slope that led downwards from her cave and towards a line of
scrubby and gnarled trees, which marked the edge of a steep but quite shallow
gully, from, which a whole new range of offensive smells was emanating  said arthur, though he didnt know for what 
arthur realised just in time what she intended 
after an hour or two of uncommunicative silence, the old woman decided that
the solar panels had absorbed enough sunlight to run the photocopier now and
she disappeared to rummage inside her cave  she emerged at last with a few
sheaves of paper and fed them through the machine 
this is, er, this your advice then, is it? said arthur, leafing through them
uncertainly  now, as you look through this document youll see that
ive underlined all the major decisions i ever made to make them stand out 
theyre all indexed and cross-referenced  see? all i can suggest is that if you
take decisions that are exactly opposite to the sort of decisions that ive taken,
then maybe you wont finish up at the end of your life  in a smelly old cave like this!
she grabbed up her table tennis bat, rolled up her sleeve, stomped off to her
pile of dead goat-like things, and started to set about the flies with vim and
vigour 
they were so high that it wasnt possible to tell, from the ground, what was
on top of them, and arthur had to climb three before he found one that had
anything on top of it at all other than a platform covered with bird droppings  you went up the poles by climbing on the short wooden pegs
that had been hammered into them in slowly ascending spirals  anybody who
was a less diligent tourist than arthur would have taken a couple of snapshots
and sloped right off to the nearest bar &amp; grill, where you also could buy
a range of particularly sweet and gooey chocolate cakes to eat in front of the
ascetics  but, largely as a result of this, most of the ascetics had gone now  in
fact they had mostly gone and set up lucrative therapy centres on some of the
more affluent worlds in the north west ripple of the galaxy, where the living
was easier by a factor of about seventeen million, and the chocolate was just
fabulous  most of the clients who came to their therapy
centres knew about it all too well  the
world seemed to swing vertiginously around him, but it didnt worry arthur
too much  he could not die until he had been to
stavromula beta 4, and had therefore managed to cultivate a merry attitude
towards extreme personal danger  he was just
about to embark on reading the photocopied life history of the oracle, when
he was rather startled to hear a slight cough behind him 

occupied by an old man who, in turn, seemed to be occupied by profound
thoughts that were making him scowl  perhaps he couldnt hear
him  arthur
couldnt tell if he was surprised and pleased to see him or just surprsised  arthur couldnt tell if he couldnt un-
derstand or couldnt hear  dont go away 
he clambered off the small platform and climbed quickly down the spiralling
pegs, arriving at the bottom quite dizzy 
he started to make his way over to the pole on which the old man was sitting,
and then suddenly realised that he had disoriented himself on the way down
and didnt know for certain which one it was  it wasnt 
when he arrived, panting and sweating, at the top of the pole that he knew
for certain was the right one he realised that the man was, somehow or other,
mucking him about 
what do you want? shouted the old man crossly at him 
how did you get over there? called arthur in bewilder- ment 
you think im going to tell you just like that what it took me forty springs,
summers and autumns of sitting on top of a pole to work out?
what about winter?
what about winter?
dont you sit on the pole in the winter?
just because i sit up a pole for most of my life, said the man, doesnt mean
im an idiot 
the man stared out over the hot, dry scrubby landscape  from here arthur
could just see the old woman, a tiny speck in the distance, dancing up and
down swatting flies  what
advice did she give you?
do exactly the opposite of everything shes done 
hmmm  other than to do with real estate?
a beach house isnt just real estate  he seemed in one
way to be a perfectly normal shape, but his body was sitting cross-legged on
a pole forty feet away while his face was only two feet from arthurs 
a beach house, he said, doesnt even have to be on the beach  we all like to congregate, he went on, at boundary condi-
tions  this was exactly the sort of thing hed been
promised in the brochure  here was a man who seemed to be moving through
some kind of escher space saying really profound things about all sorts of stuff  the man was now stepping from pole to ground,
from ground to pole, from pole to pole, from pole to horizon and back: he was
making complete nonsense of arthurs spatial universe 
you come to me for advice, but you cant cope with anything you dont recog-
nise  hmmm  youre a seer  why dont you tell me?
the old man sighed again 
why not? ive come all this way  theyve got
racks of the stuff  well, isnt there anything thats perhaps a
bit more specific to me?
everything you see or hear or experience in any way at all is specific to you 
you create a universe by perceiving it, so everything in the universe you per-
ceive is specific to you  heres a prayer for you  lets see now: protect me from knowing what i dont
need to know  protect me from even knowing that there are things to know
that i dont know  thats it  well, thank you -
theres another prayer that goes with it thats very impor- tant, continued

chapter 10 

the old man, so youd better jot this down, too  and thats it 
ever heard of a place called stavromula beta? asked arthur 
dont mention it, said the man on the pole, and vanished 
unfortunately the smart grey crushed leather sofa wasnt there 
why, thought ford, as he twisted himself round in mid-air, lurched, dived and
scuttled for cover behind harls desk, did people have this stupid obsession
with rearranging their office furniture every five minutes?
why, for instance, replace a perfectly serviceable if rather muted grey crushed
leather sofa with what appeared to be a small tank?
and who was the big guy with the mobile rocket launcher on his shoulder?
someone from head office? couldnt be  where these infinidim enterprises guys came
from zarquon knew  nowhere very sunny, judging from the slug-like colour
and texture of their skins 
there were several of them, in fact, and all of them seemed to be more heavily
armed and armoured than you normally expected corporate executives to be,
even in todays rough and tumble business world  he was assuming that the
big, bull-necked, slug-like guys were in some way connected with infinidim
enterprises, but it was a reasonable assumption and he felt happy about it
because they had logos on their armour-plating which said infinidim enter-
prises on them 
well, he had been in the room for a good two and a half seconds now, and74

chapter 11 

thought that it was probably about time to start doing something construc-
tive 
vann harl was in his swivel chair, looking alarmed, pale and shaken 
under the pretext of getting him into a good solid double underpinned elbow-
lock, ford managed surreptitiously to slip the ident-i-eeze back into harls
inner pocket 
bingo!
hed done what he came to do 
the big guy with the rocket launcher was turning towards ford prefect and
pointing it at him, which ford couldnt help feeling was wildly irresponsible
behaviour 
there was a deafening roar as flames leapt from the back of the rocket launcher
and a rocket leapt from its front 
the rocket hurtled past ford and hit the large plate-glass window, which
billowed outwards in a shower of a million shards under the force of the ex-
plosion  huge shock waves of noise and air pressure reverberated around the
room, sweeping a couple of chairs, a filing cabinet and colin the security robot
out of the window 
ah! so theyre not totally rocket-proof after all, thought ford prefect to him-
self  he disentangled
himself from harl and tried to work out which way to run  but he wasnt certain how far saying things
like look in a stern voice was necessarily going to get him, and time was
not on his side  what the hell, he thought, youre only young once, and threw
himself out of the window 



the first thing arthur dent had to do, he realised resignedly, was to get him-
self a life  it had to be somewhere where
the acid levels were low and the plants didnt actually attack you 
i hate to be anthropic about this, he said to the strange thing behind the
desk at the resettlement advice centre on pintleton alpha, but id quite like
to live somewhere where the people look vaguely like me as well  it oozed and glopped off its seat, thrashed
its way slowly across the floor, ingested the old metal filing cabinet and then,
with a great belch, excreted the appropriate drawer  it popped out a couple of
glistening tentacles from its ear, removed some files from the drawer, sucked
the drawer back in and vomited up the cabinet again 
in the space where his own home should have been there was a rotten hick
planet, drowned with rain and inhabited by thugs and boghogs  even the
hitch hikers guide to the galaxy seemed to work only fitfully here, which
was why he was reduced to making these sorts of enquiries in these sorts of
places  one place he always asked after was stavromula beta, but no one had
ever heard of such a planet  they had little to offer him because76

chapter 12  he had been extremely chastened to realise that
although he originally came from a world which had cars and computers and
ballet and armagnac he didnt, by himself, know how any of it worked  he
couldnt do it  left to his own devices he couldnt build a toaster 
arthurs heart sank  he so much wanted to do the crossword 
the strange thing was pulsating irritably at him, tapping some kind of pseu-
dopodia on the desk 
it was a world called bartledan  but the thing that most aroused his
interest was a photograph of a small bunch of bartledanian people, standing
around in a village square, smiling pleasantly at the camera 
its eyes squirmed out on stalks and roiled up and down the piece of paper,
leaving a glistening trail of slime all over it 

arthur moved to bartledan and, using some money he had made by selling
some toenail clippings and spit to a dna bank, he bought himself a room in
the village featured in the picture  they
didnt attack him with anything  but the literature of bartledan, famed though
it was throughout this sector of the galaxy for its subtlety and grace, didnt
seem to be able to sustain his interest  the problem was that it wasnt actu-
ally about human beings after all  it wasnt about what human beings wanted 
the people of bartledan were remarkably like human beings to look at, but
when you said good evening to one, he would tend to look around with a
slight sense of surprise, sniff the air and say that, yes, he supposed that it
probably was a goodish evening now that arthur came to mention it 
wish? the bartledanian would say at last, in polite bafflement  im just expressing the hope that 
on the one hand he could only recognise and respect what he learnt about the
bartledanian view of the universe, which was that the universe was what the
universe was, take it or leave it 
he had long ago realised that a lot of things that he had thought of as natural,
like buying people presents at christmas, stopping at red lights or falling at a
rate of 32 feet/second/second, were just the habits of his own world and didnt
necessarily work the same way anywhere else; but not to wish - that really
couldnt be natural, could it? that would be like not breathing 
breathing was another thing that the bartledanians didnt do, despite all the
oxygen in the atmosphere  occasionally they ran
around and played netball and stuff (without ever wishing to win though, of
course - they would just play, and whoever won, won), but they never actu-
ally breathed  arthur quickly learned
that playing netball with them was just too spooky  though they looked like
humans, and even moved and sounded like humans, they didnt breathe and
they didnt wish for things  but nobody in bar-
tledanian stories ever wanted anything  certainly,
they would fetch one if they were thirsty, but if there wasnt one available,
they would think no more about it 
it wasnt even the climax of the book, because there wasnt one  the char-
acter died about a third of the way through the penultimate chapter of the
book, and the rest of it was just more stuff about road-mending  the book
just finished dead at the one hundred thousandth word, because that was how
long books were on bartledan  he settled nowhere, but only existed in the
hermetic, twilight world of the cabins of hyperspatial starships, eating, drink-
ing, sleeping, watching movies, only stopping at spaceports to donate more
dna and catch the next long-haul ship out  the ship he was on blipped in hyperspace,
flickered horribly between ninety-seven different points in the galaxy simul-
taneously, caught the unexpected gravitational pull of an uncharted planet
in one of them, became ensnared in its outer atmosphere and began to fall,
screaming and tearing, into it 
the ships systems protested all the way down that everything was perfectly
normal and under control, but when it went into a final hectic spin, ripped
wildly through half a mile of trees and finally exploded into a seething ball of
flame it became clear that this was not the case 
fire engulfed the forest, boiled into the night, then neatly put itself out, as all

79

unscheduled fires over a certain size are now required to do by law 
arthur dent, because of the sheer boredom of endless inter- stellar flight, was
the only one on board who had actually familiarised himself with the ships
safety procedures in case of an unscheduled landing, and was therefore the sole
survivor  he lay dazed, broken and bleeding in a sort of fluffy pink plastic
cocoon with have a nice day printed in over three thousand different lan-
guages all over it 
black, roaring silences swam sickeningly through his shattered mind  he knew
with a kind of resigned certainty that he would survive, because he had not
yet been to stavromula beta 
again, he hadnt really thought things through, really, and was just playing
it by ear, buying time  hum drum stuff, hed been through it all be-
fore  boring times on betelgeuse five  zaphod beeblebrox
as a kid  trying not to inhale glass  oh for zarks sake, this was like some sort of
bloody travelogue documentary before the main feature  they worked out of a hut on the bwenelli atoll on
fanalla before the riktanarqals and the danqueds vertled it  most importantly a lot of fanallan rum  to
be completely accurate, that ol janx spirit was the absolute most important
thing, then the fanallan rum, and also some of the beaches on the atoll where
the local girls would hang out, but the dreams were important as well 

he couldnt quite remember what the dreams were in fact, but they had seemed
immensely important at the time  where were the dreams in that? he thought of all the
corporate lawyers who occupied half of the building, all the operatives who
occupied the lower levels, and all the sub-editors and their secretaries and their
secretaries lawyers and their secretaries lawyers secretaries, and worst of
all the accountants and the marketing department 
he was just passing the seventeenth floor now, where the marketing depart-
ment hung out  load of tosspots all arguing about what colour the guide
should be and exercising their infinitely infallible skills of being wise after the
event  if any of them had chosen to look out of the window at that moment
they would have been startled by the sight of ford prefect dropping past them
to his certain death and flicking v-signs at them  what about all that copy of his theyd
cut? fifteen years of research hed filed from one planet alone and theyd cut
it to two words  he had a very shrewd suspicion that it was they
who had engineered his fifteen-year exile while the guide metamorphosed into
the corporate monolith (or rather, duolith - mustnt forget the lawyers) it had
become 
he suddenly remembered the floor display panel in the eleva- tor  it hadnt
had a thirteenth floor  hed thought no more about it because, having spent
fifteen years on the rather backward planet earth where they were super-
stitious about the number thirteen, he was used to being in buildings that
numbered their floors without it 

83

what was going on in there? he started to remember all the stuff that harl
had been talking about  one, new, multi- dimensional guide spread across
an infinite number of universes 
it had sounded, the way harl had put it,
like wild meaninglessness dreamed up by the marketing department with the
backing of the accountants  a hundred feet or so below him people were milling around,
some of them beginning to look up expect- antly 
even temporarily calling off the wonderful and completely fatuous hunt for
wockets 
he would hate to disappoint them, but about two feet below him, he hadnt
realised before, was colin  colin had obviously been happily dancing atten-
dance and waiting for him to decide what he wanted to do 
colin didnt respond  then he suddenly realised that he
hadnt told colin his name was colin 
colin bobbed up beside him  colin was enjoying the ride down immensely and
hoped that ford was, too 
colins world went unexpectedly dark as fords towel suddenly enveloped him 
colin immediately felt himself get much, much heavier 
the towel was slung over colin  other hitch hikers had seen fit to modify their towels in exotic ways,
weaving all kinds of esoteric tools and utilities and even computer equipment
into their fabric  ford was a purist  it even had a
kind of blue and pink floral pattern despite his repeated attempts to bleach
and stone wash it 

84

chapter 13 
your name, shouted ford, is colin  or rather a sort of muffled groaning sound from colin  they were descending very slow- ly now, but ford was very anx-
ious about the sort of people he could see assembling on the ground beneath
him  friendly, local, wocket-hunting types were dispersing, and thick, heavy,
bull-necked, slug-like creatures with rocket launchers were, it seemed, sliding
out of what was usually called thin air  thin air, as all experienced galactic
travellers well know, is, in fact, extremely thick with multi-dimensional com-
plexities  up! colin, go up!
colin was straining and groaning  ford couldnt believe it  these were the guide
offices he was hanging outside, for zarks sake, in danger of his life from the
people who now appeared to own the thing  what had become of all the
dreams he vaguely remembered having on the bwenelli atoll? they should
have let it all be  he should have known it was all wrong the
moment they started hanging grand pianos over the sea-monster pool in the
atrium  i expect youd like a nice warm footbath to
make you feel better, wouldnt you? or at least youd like me to 

85

the armoured slug had hoisted the rocket launcher up on to its shoulder 
with the toe of his good foot he nudged and prised at the heel of the shoe on
his hurting foot 
go up, damn you! ford muttered hopelessly to colin, who was cheerily
straining away but unable to rise  well that was good,
wasnt it?
with his other foot he kicked at the heel of the shoe 
the main force of the explosion was directed downwards  where, a second
earlier, there had been a squad of infinidim enterprises executives with a
rocket launcher standing on an elegant terraced plaza paved with large slabs
of lustrous stone cut from the ancient alabastrum quarries of zentalquabula
there was now, instead, a bit of a pit with nasty bits in it 
a great wump of hot air welled up from the explosion throwing ford and colin
violently up into the sky  colin slewed
wildly through the air towards the tower of the guide offices, trying delight-
edly to control himself and slow down 
the world span sickeningly round fords head as they span and twisted round
each other and then, equally sickeningly, everything suddenly stopped 
colin bobbed in the air inches away from him 
ford looked around himself in a bruised, bleeding and breath- less daze  he had, as a result, written an entire essay
on the joys of great footwear, all of which had been jettisoned in the mostly
harmless debacle 
it wouldnt be such a grim tragedy if the planet in question hadnt been de-
molished, which meant that he wouldnt even be able to get another pair 
yes, given the infinite sideways extension of probability there was, of course,
an almost infinite multiplicity of planets earth, but, when you came down to
it, a major pair of shoes wasnt something you could just replace by mucking
about in multi- dimensional space/time 
oh well, hed better make the best of it 
he was perched on a foot-wide ledge thirteen stories up the side of a building
and he wasnt at all sure that that was worth a good shoe 
he stared in woozily through the darkened glass  hed been to some great parties in
tombs 
could he detect some movement? he wasnt quite sure  it seemed that he
could see some kind of weird, flapping shad- ow  perhaps it was just blood
dribbling over his eyelashes   boy, hed love to have a
farm somewhere, keep some sheep  he peered into the window again, trying
to make out what the shape was, but he had the feeling, so common in todays
universe, that he was looking into some kind of optical illusion and that his
eyes were just playing silly buggers with him 
was there a bird of some kind in there? was that what they had hidden away
up here on a concealed floor behind darkened, rocket-proof glass? someones
aviary? there was certainly something flapping about in there, but it seemed
like not so much a bird, more a kind of bird-shaped hole in space 
he closed his eyes, which hed been wanting to do for a bit anyway  he won-
dered what the hell to do next  jump? climb? he didnt think there was going
to be any way of breaking in  ok, the supposedly rocket-proof glass hadnt
stood up, when it came to it, to an actual rocket, but then that had been a
rocket that had been fired at very short range from inside, which probably
wasnt what the engineers who designed it had had in mind  it didnt mean he
was going to be able to break the window here by wrapping his fist in his towel

87

and punching  it was just
as well he couldnt get a good swing from where he was sitting or he might
have hurt it quite badly  the building had been sturdily reinforced when it
was completely rebuilt after the frogstar attack, and was probably the most
heavily armoured publishing company in the business, but there was always,
he thought, some weakness in any system designed by a corporate committee 
the thing they wouldnt be expecting him to do was to be there in the first
place  he
slid the window open and almost fell backwards off the ledge laughing, giving
thanks as he did so for the great ventilation and telephone riots of srdt 3454 

the great ventilation and telephone riots of srdt 3454 had started off as
just a lot of hot air  hot air was, of course, the problem that ventilation was
supposed to solve and generally it had solved the problem reasonably well up
to the point when someone invented air-conditioning, which solved the prob-
lem far more throbbingly 
and that was all well and good provided you could stand the noise and the
dribbling until someone else came up with something even sexier and smarter
than air-conditioning which was called in-building climate control 
the major differences from just ordinary air-conditioning were that it was
thrillingly more expensive, involved a huge amount of sophisticated measuring
and regulating equipment which was far better at knowing, moment by mo-
ment, what kind of air people wanted to breathe than mere people did 
it also meant that, to be sure that mere people didnt muck up the sophisticated
calculations which the system was making on their behalf, all the windows in
the buildings were built sealed shut 

smart systems fitters which went something like this:
but what if we want to have the windows open?
you wont want to have the windows open with new breathe- o-smart 
hmmm 
enjoy breathe-o-smart!
ok, so what if the breathe-o-smart breaks down or goes wrong or some-
thing?
ah! one of the smartest features of the breathe-o-smart is that it cannot
possibly go wrong 
(it was, of course, as a result of the great ventilation and telephone riots of
srdt 3454, that all mechanical or electri- cal or quantum-mechanical or hy-
draulic or even wind, steam or piston-driven devices, are now requited to have
a certain legend emblazoned on them somewhere  it doesnt matter how small
the object is, the designers of the object have got to find a way of squeezing
the legend in somewhere, because it is their attention which is being drawn to
it rather than necessarily that of the users )
major heat waves started to coincide, with almost magical precision, with ma-
jor failures of the breathe-o-smart systems  to begin with this merely caused
simmering resentment and only a few deaths from asphyxiation 
the first event was that breathe-o-smart inc 
the second event was the breakdown of a breathe-o-smart system on a par-
ticularly hot and humid day with the resulting evacuation of many hundreds
of office staff into the street where they met the third event, which was a
rampaging mob of long- distance telephone operators who had got so twisted
with having to say, all day and every day, thank you for using bs&amp;s
to every single idiot who picked up a phone that they had finally taken to the
streets with trash cans, megaphones and rifles 
in the ensuing days of carnage every single window in the city, rocket-proof or
not, was smashed, usually to accompanying cries of get off the line, asshole!
i dont care what number you want, what extension youre calling from  go

89

and stick a firework up your bottom! yeeehaah! hoo hoo hoo! velooooom!
squawk! and a variety of other animal noises that they didnt get a chance
to practise in the normal line of their work  all
sorts of stressed and rising executives who had been forced, during the dark
days of the breathe-o-smart tyr- anny, to jump in front of trains or stab them-
selves, could now just clamber out on to their own window ledges and leap off
at their leisure  what frequently happened, though, was that in the moment
or two they had to look around and gather their thoughts they would sud-
denly discover that all they had really needed was a breath of air and a fresh
perspective on things, and maybe also a farm on which they could keep a few
sheep 
another completely unlooked for result was that ford prefect, stranded thir-
teen stories up a heavily armoured building armed with nothing but a towel and
a credit card was nevertheless able to clamber through a supposedly rocket-
proof window to safety 
he closed the window neatly after him, having first allowed colin to follow
him through, and then started to look around for this bird thing 
the thing he realised about the windows was this: because they had been
converted into openable windows after they had first been designed to be im-
pregnable, they were, in fact, much less secure than if they had been designed
as openable windows in the first place 
hey ho, its a funny old life, he was just thinking to himself, when he suddenly
realised that the room he had gone to all this trouble to break into was not a
very interesting one 
where was the strange flapping shape? where was anything that was worth
all this palaver - the extraordinary veil of secrecy that seemed to lie over this
room and the equally extraordinary sequence of events that had seemed to
conspire to get him into it?
the room, like every other room in this building now, was done out in some
appallingly tasteful grey 
there was a kind of bird-like logo on it, and a slogan which said the hitch
hikers guide to the galaxy mk ii: the single most astounding thing of any

90

chapter 13  then his attention was gradually drawn to colin,
the absurdly over-happy security robot, who was cowering in a corner of the
room gibbering with what seemed strangely like fear  he looked around to see what it was that colin might
have been reacting to  then he saw something that he hadnt noticed before,
lying quietly on top of a work bench 
its top
and its bottom were smoothly convex so that it resembled a small lightweight
throwing discus  there hadnt been anything written on it a moment ago and
now suddenly there was  there just didnt seem to have been any observable
transition between the two states 
all it said, in small, alarming letters was a single word:

panic

a moment ago there hadnt been any marks or cracks in its surface 
panic, the guide mk ii said  their colour scheme
was a kind of corporate grey, but in all other respects they looked exactly like
vogons  one mo-
ment it was a perfectly ordinary late afternoon in the early autumn - the
leaves were just beginning to turn red and gold, the river was beginning to
swell again with the rains from the mountains in the north, the plumage of
the pikka birds was begin- ning to thicken in anticipation of the coming winter
frosts, any day now the perfectly normal beasts would start their thunderous
migration across the plains, and old thrashbarg was beginning to mutter to
himself as he hobbled his way around the village, a muttering which meant
that he was rehearsing and elaborating the stories that he would tell of the
past year once the evenings had drawn in and people had no choice but to
gather round the fire and listen to him and grumble and say that that wasnt
how they remembered it - and the next moment there was a spaceship sitting
there, gleaming in the warm autumn sun 
it wasnt a big spaceship  if the villagers had been experts on spaceships they
would have known at once that it was a pretty nifty one, a small sleek hrundi
four-berth runabout with just about every optional extra in the brochure ex-
cept advanced vectoid stabilisis, which only wimps went for  you cant get
a good tight, sharp curve round a tri-lateral time axis with advanced vectoid
stabilisis 
the villagers didnt know all that, of course  most of them here on the remote
planet of lamuella had never seen a spaceship, certainly not one that was all
in one piece, and as it shone warmly in the evening light it was just the most
extraordinary thing they had come across since the day kirp caught a fish
with a head at both ends 

whereas a moment before two or three dozen people had been wandering
about, chattering, chopping wood, carrying water, teasing the pikka birds, or
just amiably trying to stay out of old thrashbargs way, suddenly all activity
died away and everybody turned to look at the strange object in amazement  the pikka birds tended to be amazed by completely
different things  a perfectly ordinary leaf lying unexpectedly on a stone would
cause them to skitter off in par- oxysms of confusion; sunrise took them com-
pletely by surprise every morning, but the arrival of an alien craft from another
world simply failed to engage any part of their attention  they continued to
kar and rit and huk as they pecked for seeds on the ground; the river continued
with its quiet, spacious burbling 
also, the noise of loud and tuneless singing from the last hut on the left con-
tinued unabated 
suddenly, with a slight click and a hum, a door folded itself outwards and
downwards from the spaceship  old thrashbarg tried to shoo them back  this was
exactly the sort of thing that old thrashbarg didnt like to have happening 
he hadnt foretold it, not even slightly, and even though he would be able to
wrestle the whole thing into his continuing story somehow or other, it really
was all getting a bit much to deal with 
he strode forward, pushed the boys back, and raised his arms and his ancient
knobbly staff into the air  time went by and old thrashbargs arms were beginning to
ache  that made it easy for thrash-
barg  the reason he hadnt
foretold it was that prudence and modesty forbade 
almost immediately a different ramp folded itself out on the other side of the
craft from where thrashbarg was standing, and two figures at last emerged
on it, still arguing with each other and ignoring everybody, even thrashbarg,
whom they wouldnt even have noticed from where they were standing 
old thrashbarg chewed angrily on his beard  they were really hurting so he didnt have much choice 
the taller one was a very good looking woman wearing soft and crumply
clothes  old thrashbarg didnt know this, but they were made of rymplon
tm, a new synthetic fabric which was terrific for space travel because it looked
its absolute best when it was all creased and sweaty 
all eyes watched them, except for the pikka birds, which had their own things
to watch 
there was obviously something in particular she wanted, but she didnt know
exactly where to find it  she glanced from face to face among the villagers as-
sembled curiously around her without apparently seeing what she was looking
for 
thrashbarg had no idea how to play this at all, and decided to resort to chant-
ing  without so much as a glance at old thrashbarg she started to walk
towards the hut  it is a simple task, but the oppor-
tunities for satisfaction are many and profound: choosing the right bread for
instance  the sandwich maker had spent many months in daily consultation
and experiment with grarp the baker and eventually they had between them
created a loaf of exactly the consistency that was dense enough to slice thinly
and neatly, while still being light, moist and having that fine nutty flavour
which best enhanced the savour of roast perfectly normal beast flesh 

lightness was a virtue, but so too were firmness, generosity and that promise
of succulence and savour that is the hallmark of a truly intense sandwich ex-
perience 
the proper tools, of course, were crucial, and many were the days that the
sandwich maker, when not engaged with the baker at his oven, would spend
with strinder the tool maker, weighing and balancing knives, taking them
to the forge and back again  suppleness, strength, keenness of edge, length
and balance were all enthusiastically debated, theories put forward, tested,
refined, and many was the evening when the sandwich maker and the tool
maker could be seen silhouetted against the light of the setting sun and the
tool makers forge making slow sweeping movements through the air trying
one knife after another, comparing the weight of this one with the balance of
another, the suppleness of a third and the handle binding of a fourth  first there was the knife for the slicing
of the bread: a firm, authoritative blade which imposed a clear and defining
will on a loaf  then there was the butter-spreading knife, which was a whippy
little number but still with a firm backbone to it  the sand-
wich maker would then flip each sheet with a smooth flick of the wrist on to
the beautifully proportioned lower bread slice, trim it with four deft strokes
and then at last perform the magic that the children of the village so longed to
gather round and watch with rapt attention and wonder  with just four more
dexterous flips of the knife he would assemble the trimmings into a perfectly
fitting jigsaw of pieces on top of the primary slice 
the sandwich maker would pass what he had made to his assistant who would
then add a few slices of newcumber and fladish and a touch of splagberry sauce,
and then apply the topmost layer of bread and cut the sandwich with a fourth
and altogether plainer knife  there were those in the village who were happy chop-
ping wood, those who were content carrying water, but to be the sandwich
maker was very heaven  it was a little past its best
now, but still the rich savour of perfectly normal beast meat was something
unsurpassed in any of the sandwich makers previous experience  next week it
was anticipated that the perfectly normal beasts would appear again for their
regu- lar migration, whereupon the whole village would once again be plunged
into frenetic action: hunting the beasts, killing perhaps six, maybe even seven
dozen of the thousands that thundered past  the celebrations would last for three days of
sheer exuberance, dancing and stories that old thrashbarg would tell of how
the hunt had gone, stories that he would have been busy sitting making up in
his hut while the rest of the village was out doing the actual hunting  and the sandwich maker would exer-
cise on it the skills that he had brought to them from the gods, and make the
exquisite sandwiches of the third season, of which the whole village would
partake before beginning, the next day, to prepare themselves for the rigours
of the coming winter  he flipped each slice of meat neatly on to a slice of bread,
trimmed it and assembled all the trimmings into their jigsaw 

thrashbarg said, and thrashbarg was the authority on these things  so, at
least, thrashbarg claimed, and thrashbarg was 
a few villagers wondered why almighty bob would send his onlie begotten
sandwich maker in a burning fiery chariot rather than perhaps in one that
might have landed quietly without destroying half the forest, filling it with
ghosts and also injuring the sandwich maker quite badly  old thrashbarg
said that it was the ineffable will of bob, and when they asked him what
ineffable meant he said look it up 
this was a problem because old thrashbarg had the only dictionary and he
wouldnt let them borrow it  anyway, somebody sneaked into
old thrashbargs hut one day while he was out having a swim and looked up
ineffable 
one day old thrashbarg said that almighty bob had decreed that he, thrash-
barg, was to have first pick of the sandwiches  the villagers asked him when
this had happened, exactly, and thrashbarg said it had happened yesterday,
when they werent looking  have faith, old thrashbarg said, or burn!
they let him have first pick of the sandwiches  his fame had obviously spread, though it was hard
to know where to since, according to old thrashbarg, there wasnt anywhere
else  who was
she? and who was the strange girl who was hanging around outside the hut
moodily and kicking at stones and showing every sign of not wanting to be
there? it seemed odd that someone should come all the way from somewhere
ineffable in a chariot that was obviously a vast improvement on the burning
fiery one which had brought them the sandwich maker, if she didnt even want
to be here?
they all looked to thrashbarg, but he was on his knees mumbling and looking
very firmly up into the sky and not catching anybody elses eye until hed
thought of something ?

exactly the questions i was going to ask you, said trillian, looking around
arthurs hut  a door at
the back of the room led to something trillian couldnt see because the door
was closed  nice, she said, but in an enquiring tone of voice  she couldnt
quite make out what the set-up was 
i dont know when ive ever
been anywhere nicer  im happy here  er, well thats it really 
sounds, er  i dont expect youd like
it very much, but for me its, well, its perfect  can i get you anything, er, a sandwich?
trillian picked up a sandwich and looked at it 
trillian took a nibble, then a bite and munched on it thought- fully 
my lifes work, said arthur, trying to sound proud and hoping he didnt
sound like a complete idiot  he was used to being revered a bit, and was hav-
ing to go through some unexpected mental gear changes 
whats the meat in it? asked trillian 
ah yes, thats, um, thats perfectly normal beast 
so whats odd about it?
nothing, its perfectly normal 
tricia frowned, and stopped chewing  she wasnt going
to swallow until she knew  ive eaten tons of it 
very succulent  slightly sweet flavour with a long dark finish 
trillian still hadnt swallowed 
theyre the big ones behind us here, you must have seen them as you came in,

98

chapter 14 

and then they sweep in their thousands across the great anhondo plains and,
er, well thats it really  thats where they come from  thats where they go 
trillian frowned  there was something she wasnt quite getting about this 
i probably havent made it quite clear, said arthur  when i say they come
from a point to the east of the hondo moun- tains, i mean that thats where
they suddenly appear  then they sweep across the anhondo plains and, well,
vanish really 
reluctantly, trillian swallowed 
i see, she said, once she had reassured herself that she didnt seem to be
suffering any ill effects  i think
old thrashbarg called them that  he says that they come from where they
come from and they go to where they go to and that its bobs will and thats
all there is to it 
just dont even ask 
im well  im very well 
well, thats good 
i expect youre wondering how i found you, said trillian  yes, youve done
very well  thats terrific  you dont have a whole spaceliner disappear with-
out someone knowing about it 
but you mean, they knew where it had happened? they knew id survived?
yes 
but nobodys ever been to look or search or rescue  theres been absolutely
nothing 
well there wouldnt be  the insurance business is
completely screwy now  you know theyve reintroduced the death penalty for
insurance company directors?
really? said arthur  no i didnt  for what offence?
trillian frowned 
trillian gave arthur a long look, and then, in a new tone of voice, said, its
time for you to take responsibility, arthur 
he still didnt quite understand what she meant, though, so in the end he had
to say so 
trillian gave him a cool smile and then turned back to the door of the hut 



as the guide folded itself back into a smooth, dark disk, ford realised some
pretty hectic stuff  or at least he tried to realise it, but it was too hectic to
take in all in one go  his head was hammering, his ankle was hurting, and
though he didnt like to be a wimp about his ankle, he always found that in-
tense multi- dimensional logic was something he understood best in the bath  he didnt
think theyd make it together 
he wouldnt try to beat the system, he would just use it  the frightening thing
about the vogons was their absolute mindless determination to do whatever
mindless thing it was they were determined to do  there was never any point
in trying to appeal to their reason because they didnt have any  however, if
you kept your nerve you could sometimes exploit their blinkered, bludgeoning
insistence on being bludgeoning and blinkered  it wasnt merely that their left
hand didnt always know what their right hand was doing, so to speak; quite
often their right hand had a pretty hazy notion as well 
did he dare just post the thing to himself?
did he dare just put it in the system and let the vogons work out how to
get the thing to him while at the same time they were busy, as they probably
would be, tearing the building apart to find out where hed hidden it?
yes  with a moments102

chapter 15 
im so happy, said colin  theyll probably incinerate you when
they find you, and i wont be here to help  it will be very, very nasty for you,
and thats just too bad  got it?
i gurgle with pleasure, said colin 
colin obediently dived down the mail chute in pursuit of his charge 
with a deafening roar the door exploded inwards 
so everything was going well was it? everything was working out as if the
most extraordinary luck was on his side? well, hed see about that 
in a spirit of scientific enquiry he hurled himself out of the window again 
the second month, trying to come to terms with what theyd got to know
about each other in the first month, was much easier 
this had been a pleasantly simple matter for arthur, here on lamuella  the
days were just a little over twenty-five hours long, which basically meant an
extra hour in bed every single day and, of course, having regularly to reset his
watch, which arthur rather enjoyed doing 
he also felt at home with the number of suns and moons which lamuella had
- one of each - as opposed to some of the planets hed fetched up on from time
to time which had had ridiculous numbers of them 
the planet orbited its single sun every three hundred days, which was a good
number because it meant the year didnt drag by  the moon orbited lamuella
just over nine times a year, which meant that a month was a little over thirty
days, which was absolutely perfect because it gave you a little more time to
get things done in 
trillian had warned arthur that random might have some difficulty in ad-
justing to a more regular lifestyle than she had been used to up till now, but
arthur hadnt been ready for actual howling at the moon 
he hadnt been ready for any of this of course 
his daughter?
his daughter? he and trillian had never even - had they? he was absolutely104

chapter 16  what about zaphod?
not the same species, arthur, trillian had answered  it was only later that it dawned on me  they dont usually like to tell you, but i insisted 
you mean you went to a dna bank? arthur had asked, pop-eyed  but she wasnt quite as random as her name suggests, because, of course,
you were the only homo sapiens donor 
arthur had stared wide-eyed at the unhappy looking girl who was slouching
awkwardly in the door-frame looking at him 
what do you mean?
i mean that i havent any idea 
what?
well, in my time line i think its about ten years since i had her, but shes
obviously quite a lot older than that  i spend my life going backwards and
forwards in time, you see  i used to take her with me when i could,
but it just wasnt always possible  you leave them there
in the morning, youve simply no idea how old theyll be in the evening  you
complain till youre blue in the face but it doesnt get you anywhere  ive done all i can, arthur, its over to you  ive got a war to cover 

the ten seconds that passed after trillian left were about the longest of
arthur dents life 
this will come to you as a profound personal shock, particularly if you didnt
know you had a twin brother or sister  the seconds that you have been absent
for will not have been sufficient time to prepare you for the shock of new and
strangely distended family relationships when you return 
ten seconds silence was not enough time for arthur to reassemble his whole
view of himself and his life in a way that suddenly included an entire new

105

daughter of whose merest exist- ence he had had not the slightest inkling of
a suspicion when he had woken that morning 
i dont love you, he said  im sorry  i dont even know you yet  the people with whom we populate our universes are
the shadows of whole other universes intersecting with our
own  being able to glance out into this bewildering complexity
of infinite recursion and say things like, oh, hi ed! nice tan 
hows carol? involves a great deal of filtering skill for which
all conscious entities have eventually to develop a capacity in
order to protect themselves from the contemplation of the
chaos through which they seethe and tumble  so give your
kid a break, ok?

extract from practical parenting in a fractally
demented universe

whats this?

arthur had almost given up 
not content with being surly, bad-tempered, wanting to go and play in the pa-
leozoic era, not seeing why they had to have the gravity on the whole time and
shouting at the sun to stop following her, random had also used his carving
knife to dig up stones to throw at the pikka birds for looking at her like that 
arthur didnt even know if lamuella had had a paleozoic era  according to
old thrashbarg the planet had been found fully-formed in the navel of a giant
earwig at four-thirty one vroonday afternoon, and although arthur, as a sea-
soned galactic traveller with good o level passes in physics and geography,
had fairly serious doubts about this, it was rather a waste of time trying to
argue with old thrashbarg and there had never been much point before  it wasnt easy being a father  he knew
that no one had ever said it was going to be easy, but that wasnt the point
because hed never asked about being one in the first place 
or rather, it was about the size of trillian and of her they had slightly differing
views 
whats this?
he suddenly realised she had been talking to him and he hadnt noticed 
her mood swings were very unpredictable but so far theyd all been between
different types of bad ones  outbreaks of bitter recrimination would give way
without warning to abject self-pity and then long bouts of sullen despair which
were punctuated with sudden acts of mindless violence against inanimate ob-
jects and demands to go to electric clubs  there was a forge and a bakery, a few carts and
a well, but those were the high water mark of lamuellan technology, and a
fair number of randoms unquenchable rages were directed against the sheer
incomprehensible backwardness of the place 
she could pick up sub-etha tv on a small flex-o-panel which had been sur-
gically implanted in her wrist, but that didnt cheer her up at all because it
was full of news of insanely exciting things happening in every other part of
the galaxy than here  it also gave her access to lots of
great adventure shows featuring all sorts of fantastically expensive spaceships

107

crashing into each other 
the villagers were absolutely hypnotised by all these wonderful magic images
flashing over her wrist  they had only ever seen one spaceship crash, and it
had been so frightening, violent and shocking and had caused so much horri-
ble devastation, fire and death that, stupidly, they had never realised it was
entertainment 
old thrashbarg had been so astonished by it that he had instantly seen ran-
dom as an emissary from bob, but had fairly soon afterwards decided that in
fact she had been sent as a test of his faith, if not of his patience  he was also
alarmed at the number of spaceship crashes he had to start incorporating into
his holy stories if he was to hold the attention of the villagers, and not have
them rushing off to peer at randoms wrist all the time  he had taken it off when hed gone to shower under the local
waterfall, and random had found it and was trying to work it out  but you keep on fiddling with it, and it still doesnt
tell the right time 
she brought up the display on her wrist panel, which auto- matically produced
a readout of local time  her wrist panel had quietly got on with the business of
measuring the local gravity and orbital momentum, and had noticed where the
sun was and tracked its movement in the sky, all within the first few minutes
of randoms arrival  it had then quickly picked up clues from its environment
as to what the local unit conventions were and reset itself appropriately 
random frowned at her fathers watch, which didnt do any of this  he had been given it on his twenty-second birthday by a rich
and guilt-ridden godfather who had forgotten every single birthday he had had
up till then, and also his name 
the watch had been through a considerahle amount of stuff in the last few
years, most of which would fall well outside the warranty  he didnt suppose,
of course, that the warranty had especially mentioned that the watch was
guaranteed to be accu- rate only within the very particular gravitational and
magnetic fields of the earth, and so long as the day was twenty-four hours long

108

chapter 16 

and the planet didnt explode and so on  nowhere else
in the galaxy would he have found batteries of pre- cisely the dimensions and
power specifications that were perfectly standard on earth 
and thats where you came from, and where mum came from 
whats that noise?
its ticking  thats the mechanism that drives the watch 
theres something puzzling you, said arthur  whys it all in hardware?

arthur suggested they went for a walk 
from randoms point of view this was also all very weird  it wasnt that she
wanted to be difficult, as such, it was just that she didnt know how or what
else to be 
who was this guy? what was this life she was supposed to lead? what was
this world she was supposed to lead it in? and what was this universe that
kept coming at her through her eyes and ears? what was it for? what did it
want?

109

shed been born in a spaceship that had been going from somewhere to some-
where else, and when it had got to some- where else, somewhere else had only
turned out to be another somewhere that you had to get to somewhere else
again from, and so on 
she didnt notice that she felt this, because it was the only way she ever felt,
just as it never seemed odd to her that nearly everywhere she went she needed
either to wear weights or anti-gravity suits and usually special apparatus for
breathing as well 
and that included this lamuella place her mother had dumped her in 
it can be very dangerous to see things from somebody elses point of view
without the proper training 
the only thing that arthur wasnt quite so fond of was being able to see a
little way into the next valley, where a deep dark mangled furrow in the forest
marked the spot where his ship had crashed 
wouldnt 
couldnt bear it  he had a broken leg, a couple of broken
ribs, some bad burns and was not really thinking coherently but had insisted
that the villagers take him, which, uneasily, they had 

random cradled the watch in her hands, slowly turning it to let the long
light of the evening sun shine warmly in the scratches and scuffs of the thick
glass  the smaller hand had
moved on to the next of the main digits 
youve been watching it for over an hour  an hour is when the big hand has gone all the way round,
yes?
thats right 
then ive been watching it for an hour and seventeen  arthur felt a small sigh
escape from him that had been pent up inside his chest for weeks 
theres nothing really to it, said arthur  i mean the thing still goes perfectly well, but it doesnt really mean
much this far from switzerland  thats where these were made  small hilly coun- try  tire-
somely neat  the people who made them didnt really know there were other
worlds 
from, i dont know, some kind of sludge or something  i dont think the watch grew out of sludge 
you dont understand!
random suddenly leaped to her feet, shouting 
you dont understand! you dont understand me, you dont understand any-
thing! i hate you for being so stupid!
she started to run hectically down the hill, still clutching the watch and shout-
ing that she hated him  he started to run after her through
the stringy and clumpy grass 
she brandished the watch at him  you dont understand that theres some-
where this belongs? somewhere it works? somewhere that it fits?
she turned and ran again 
it wasnt that he had not expected being a father to be this difficult, it was
that he hadnt expected to be a father at all, particularly not suddenly and
unexpectedly on an alien planet  your upgrade? who do
you think mum thought i was? some sort of ticket to the life she didnt have?
i dont know what you mean by that, said arthur, panting and hurting 
you dont know what anybody means by anything!
what do you mean?
shut up! shut up! shut up!
tell me! please tell me! what does she mean by saying the life she didnt
have?
she wished shed stayed on earth! she wished she hadnt gone off with

112

chapter 16 

that stupid brain-dead fruit gum, zaphod! she thinks she would have had a
different life!
but, said arthur, she would have been killed! she would have been killed
when the world was destroyed!
thats a different life isnt it?
thats 
she wouldnt have had to have me! she hates me!
you cant mean that! how could anyone possibly, er, i mean 
whats stupid about her life? shes fantastically successful, isnt she? shes
all over time and space, all over the sub-etha tv networks  arthur couldnt keep up with her and at
last he had to sit down for a bit and let the pain in his leg subside  the turmoil
in his head he didnt know what to do with at all  old
thrashbarg had been seen pulling on his beard a fair bit and looking at the
moon, and that was not a good sign either 
im sorry, she said  im so sorry 
thats all right, said arthur as gently as he knew how  theres so much we have to learn and understand about
each other, and life isnt, well it isnt all just tea and sandwiches 
im so sorry, she said again, sobbing  she didnt resist
or pull away 
in the pool of light thrown by a lamuellan lantern lay arthurs watch  ran-
dom had forced the back off it with the back edge of the butter spreading
knife, and all of the minute cogs and springs and levers were lying in a tiny
cock-eyed mess where shed been fiddling with them 
i just wanted to see how it worked, said random, how it all fitted to-
gether  im so sorry! i cant get it back together  im sorry, im sorry, im
sorry  i dont know what to do  ill get it repaired! really! ill get it repaired!

113

the following day thrashbarg came round and said all sorts of bob stuff 
he tried to exert a calming influence by inviting random to let her mind dwell
on the ineffable mystery of the giant earwig, and random said there was no
giant earwig and thrashbarg went very cold and silent and said she would be
cast into outer darkness 

this was all getting a bit eventful 

in fact, when the parcel arrived, delivered by a kind of robot drone that
dropped out of the sky making droning robot noises, it brought with it a
sense which gradually began to permeate through the whole village, that it
was almost one event too many 
it wasnt the robot drones fault  all it required was arthur dents signature
or thumb print, or just a few scrapings of skin cells from the nape of his neck
and it would be on its way again  meanwhile, kirp had caught another fish
with a head at both ends, but on closer inspection it turned out that it was in
fact two fish cut in half and sewn together rather badly, so not only had kirp
failed to rekindle any great interest in two-headed fish but he had seriously
cast doubt on the authenticity of the first one  only the pikka birds seemed
to feel that everything was exactly normal 
the robot drone got arthurs signature and made its escape 
lets open it! said random, who was feeling much more cheerful this morn-
ing now that everything around her had got thoroughly weird, but arthur said
no 
no, it isnt 
ive heard about him  what else are we going to do?
i dont know, said arthur, who really wasnt sure  he had taken his dam-
aged knives over to the forge bright and early that morning and strinder had
had a look at them and said that he would see what he could do 
i dont know, said arthur 
because anything to do with ford prefect is bound to be worse and more
worrying than something that isnt, said arthur 
youre upset about something, arent you? said random 
im just feeling a little jumpy and unsettled, i think, said arthur 
im sorry, said random, and put the package down again  she would just have to do it
when he wasnt looking 



arthur wasnt quite certain which he noticed as being missing first  when he
noticed that the one wasnt there his mind instantly leapt to the other and he
knew immediately that they were both gone and that something insanely bad
and difficult to deal with would happen as a result 
he knew that one of the things he was supposed to do as a parent was to show
trust in his child, to build a sense of trust and confidence into the bedrock of
relationship between them 
he found old thrashbarg and asked him  thrashbarg looked at him stonily,
and then pointed in the one direction that arthur had dreaded, and had there-
fore instinctively known was the way she would have gone 
he looked up at the sky, which was sullen, streaked and livid, and reflected
that it was the sort of sky that the four horsemen of the apocalypse wouldnt
feel like a bunch of complete idiots riding out of  the first heavy blobs of rain began to hit the116

chapter 17  she was a
little worried that doing the trip at night was not that great an idea, but her
father had been mooching around near the hut all day trying to pretend to
either her or himself that he wasnt guarding the parcel  at last hed had to
go over to the forge to talk with strinder about the knives, and random had
seized her opportunity and done a runner with the parcel 
it was perfectly clear that she couldnt just open the thing there, in the hut,
or even in the village  which
meant that she had to go where she wouldnt be followed  she had gone this way in the hope that
he wouldnt follow her  it was a satis-
fyingly hunky sort of thing: a box with a square top about the length of her
forearm on each side, and about the length of her hand deep, wrapped up in
brown plasper with an ingenious new form of self-knotting string  it didnt
rattle as she shook it, but she sensed that its weight was concentrated excit-
ingly at the centre  she wasnt exactly certain what the
word haunted meant, but it might be fun to find out  she hadnt used her tiny electric torch yet,
because she didnt want to be visible from a distance  she would have to use
it now, but it probably didnt matter since she would be on the other side of
the hill which divided the valleys from each other  where a short while ago it had been a few heavy blobs it was settling in

117

for a good pour now, hissing in the trees, and the ground was getting slippery
under her feet  shadows were leap-
ing and leering at her as her light bobbed through the trees  onwards and
downwards  it was very faint and she wasnt certain if she
was imagining it or not  she couldnt tell what it was 
she couldnt immediately say what it was, but they didnt seem like sprightly
healthy woods looking forward to a good spring  she scrabbled on the
ground for the torch, found it, and shone it directly at the creature  but small, furry and cuddly  poised and ready to
throw, but was increasingly conscious of the fact that the things she had it
poised and ready to throw at were squirrels 
soft, warm, cuddly squirrel-like things advancing on her in a way she wasnt
at all certain she liked 

118

chapter 17  it was making aggressive,
hectoring, screeching noises, and carrying in one of its little fists a small tat-
tered piece of wet, pink rag  random hefted her rock menacingly in her hand,
but it made no impression at all on the squirrel advancing on her with its wet
piece of rag  she didnt know at all how to deal with this  if they had
been vicious snarling slavering beasts with glistening fangs she would have
pitched into them with a will, but squirrels behaving like this she couldnt
quite handle  the second squirrel was starting to make a flanking
manoeuvre round to her right  some kind of acorn thing 
she felt almost hypnotised by the strangeness of the thing and its tiny glinting
eyes 
meanwhile random was trying to fend off the squirrel with the acorn cup full
of rain and the one with the paper  she brandished her rock at them 
the squirrels scampered round in consternation  then one darted straight at
her, dropped the acorn cup in her lap, turned and ran off into the night  the
other stood quivering for a moment, then put its scrap of paper neatly down

119

in front of her and disappeared as well 

arthur was thrashing around hopelessly two or three miles behind her, on

the upward side of the hill  this was a kind of dim hurri-
cane lamp: a perforated metal canister from strinders forge, which contained
a reservoir of inflammable fish oil, a wick of knotted dried grass and was
wrapped in a translucent film made from dried membranes from the gut of a
perfectly normal beast 
arthur jiggled around with it in a thoroughly pointless kind of a way for a few
seconds  he was absolutely sodden, his clothes heavy
and billowing with the rain, and now he was lost in the dark as well  well, he wasnt certain
what he would do  hed have to work that out when he got there 

she turned to look, he was kneeling over the body and going through its pock-
ets  a huge blue brush
appeared out of nowhere and started foamily to scrub at the teeth, which con-
tinued to hang there gleaming in the shimmering curtain of rain  the guy who had shot her was part of a holographic
in-flight movie  not only
did she have the cold and the rain and the night to contend with, but also
the fractured and thrashing remains of the ships on-board entertainment sys-
tem  spaceships and jetcars and helipods crashed and exploded continuously
around her, illuminating the night, villainous people in strange hats smug-
gled dangerous drugs through her, and the combined orchestra and chorus of
the hallapolis state opera performed the closing march of the anjaqantine
star guard from act iv of rizgars blamwellamum of woont in a little glade
somewhere off to her left  there was still a faint warm glow coming from what would otherwise
have looked like an enormous piece of caramelised chewing gum in the centre
of the pit: the melted remains of a great spaceship 
the rain was beginning to ease off a little, but it was still extremely wet, and
since she didnt know what it was that was in the box, whether it was perhaps
something delicate or dam- ageable, she thought she ought to find somewhere
reasonably dry to open it  she hoped she hadnt already damaged it by drop-
ping it 
in the middle distance she
thought she could see a jumbled outcrop of rock which might provide some
shelter, and she started to pick her way towards it  all around she found the
detritus that had been ejected from the ship as it broke up, before the final
fireball  they said dont panic  it was her fathers copy of the hitch hikers guide to
the galaxy 
she felt instantly reassured by it, turned her head up to the thundery sky and
let some  clamber- ing up and
over them she almost immediately found the perfect thing  she played her torch into its inte- rior  it was quite spacious, but didnt go
that deep  all over the
galaxy the science depart- ments of all the major universities were acquiring
more and more elaborate equipment to probe and search the hearts of distant
galaxies, and then the very centre and the very edges of the whole universe,
but when eventually it was tracked down it turned out in fact to he all the
stuff which the equipment had been packed in 
there was quite a large quantity of missing matter in the box, little soft round
white pellets of missing matter, which random discarded for future genera-
tions of physicists to track down and discover all over again once the findings
of the current generation of physicists had been lost and forgotten about 
it was a little like a pikka bird, only rather smaller  it was also both a lot bluer and a lot pinker than pikka124

chapter 18 
there was also something very odd about it, which random couldnt immedi-
ately make out 
it certainly shared with pikka birds the impression it gave that it was watching
something that you couldnt see  random drop- ped into a tense
crouch, feeling for the specially sharpened rock in her pocket again 
excuse me, it said suddenly, i just have to calibrate myself 
and can you hear me when i say this? it said, this time in a sepulchrally
deep voice  good, well your hear-
ing range is obviously between 20 and 16 khz  no uncomfortable harmonics screech-
ing away in the upper register? obviously not  random was well
used to spending time in virtual realities, but this was something far weirder
than anything she had previously encountered  how about now?
it concertina-ed into a tunnel of birds, as if it was a bird caught between par-
allel mirrors, reflecting infinitely into the distance  just how many, please?
well, youre sort of 
i see, still infinite in extent, but at least were homing in on the right dimen-
sional matrix  am i infinite now?
how yellow am i?
moment by moment the bird was going through mind-mangling transforma-
tions of shape and extent 
you dont have to answer, i can tell from watching you now  am i your
mother? am i a rock? do i seem huge, squishy and sinuously intertwined?
no? how about now? am i going backwards?
for once the bird was perfectly still and steady  hmmm  well i think
weve sorted all that out now  if youd like to know, i can tell you that in your
universe you move freely in three dimensions that you call space  after that it gets a hit
complicated, and theres all sorts of stuff going on in dimensions 13 to 22 that
you really wouldnt want to know about  i can easily not say words like damn if it offends you  in fact i inhabit what
is technically known as the whole sort of general mish mash which means 
random didnt like being bossed around by a bird, but she followed it to the
mouth of the cave anyway, still fingering the rock in her pocket 

so what is it?
what do you mean, what is it? look, who are you? what were you doing
in that box? why have i spent a night running through the forest fending off
demented squirrels to find that all ive got at the end of it is a bird asking me
what rain is  its just water falling through the bloody air, thats what it is 
anything else you want to know or can we go home now?
there was a long pause before the bird answered, you want to go home?
i havent got a home! random almost shocked herself, she screamed the
words so loudly 
im looking into the rain! what else is there to look at?
what do you see?
what do you mean, you stupid bird? i just see a load of rain 
what shapes do you see in the water?
shapes? there arent any shapes 
just a mish mash, said the bird guide  a laser show, said random fractiously 
theres nothing there that wasnt there before  im just using light to draw
your attention to certain drops at certain moments 
im doing exactly the same thing, but with ultra-violet light 
so whats the point of showing me something i cant see?
so that you understand that just because you see something, it doesnt mean
to say its there  and if you dont see something it doesnt mean to say its
not there, its only what your senses bring to your attention 
im bored with this, said random, and then gasped 
hanging in the rain was a giant and very vivid three-dimen- sional image of
her father looking startled about something  was beginning to howl and gibber 
seeing a huge bright image of himself light up in the sky told him that, on
balance, he was probably right to howl and gibber but probably wrong as far
as the direction he was heading was concerned 

ok, so whats that supposed to prove? demanded random  it was the
fact that the image was her father that had startled her rather than the ap-
pearance of the image itself  she had seen her first hologram when she was
two months old and had been put in it to play  she had seen her most recent
one about half an hour ago playing the march of the anjaqantine star guard  it makes an ap-
parently solid image in your mind  but its all just images in the mish mash 
heres another one for you  it was definite- ly randoms mother 
trillian wouldnt have been walking quite so uncertainly in low gravity, or
looking around her at a boring old life-support environment with quite such a
disbelieving look on her face, or carrying such a quaint old camera 
i havent the faintest idea what you mean 

still dunno  majestic
slowness against a black, starry background  now you dont  the whole brilliant string turned and span in a bewildering
dance in the air and then gradually slowed, grew insubstantial and faded into
the glistening darkness of the night 
a glimpse along the probability axis of a discontinuously probable object 
most objects mutate and change along their axis of prob- ability, but the
world of your origin does something slightly different  it has
an inherent instability, which is typical of anything that lies within what are
usually designated the plural sectors  it spread its wings and, with an easy
grace, ascended into the air and flew out into the rain which, once again, was

129

beginning to lighten 
it soared ecstatically up into the night sky, lights flashed around it, dimensions
dithered in its wake  it swooped and turned and looped and turned again and
came at last to rest two feet in front of randoms face, its wings beating slowly
and silently  thats because of
the filters through which you perceive it  but i was built with no filters at all,
which means i perceive the mish mash which contains all possible universes
but which has, itself, no size at all  i am omni-
scient and omnipotent, extremely vain, and, what is more, i come in a handy
self-carrying package 
a slow smile spread over randoms face  youve been winding me up!
as i said, anything is possible  lets go to
earth at some point on its, er  where it hasnt been blown up  so youre the guide 
youre joking  you are joking arent you?
let me put it another way, said the bird  reverse engineering enables us to
shortcut all the business of waiting for one of the horribly few spaceships that
passes through your galactic sector every year or so to make up its mind about
whether or not it feels like giving you a lift 
this is you being extremely vain isnt it, little bird?
the bird was silent  just after the
illuminated sausage display had drawn to its conclusion he had noticed the
faint glimmerings of further lights coming down out of the clouds and had, to
begin with, assumed it to be another piece of flashy son et lumiere 
it took a moment or so for it to dawn on him that it was an actual spaceship,
and a moment or two longer for him to realise that it was dropping directly
down to where he assumed his daughter to be  he
slithered back up to his feet and tried again  he
didnt know what it was that had been in the box, but the name on it had
been ford prefect, and that was the name he cursed as he ran 

the ship was one of the sexiest and most beautiful ones that random had

ever seen 
if she didnt know better she would have said it was an rw6  as it settled
silently beside her she realised that it actually was an rw6 and she could
scarcely breathe for excitement  an rw6 was the sort of thing you only saw
in the sort of magazines that were designed to provoke civil unrest  he stood still for a moment or so, obviously trying to
accustom his eyes to the darkness  the ship had only been on the ground for about three
minutes, and now, silently, gracefully it was rising up above the trees again,

131

turning smoothly in the fine speckle of rain to which the storm had now abated,
climbing, climbing, tipping up its nose and, suddenly, effortlessly, hurtling up
through the clouds  he wandered
disconsolately into the cave, found the empty box and piles of missing matter
pellets strewn around the place  hed tried
to teach her about cleaning up after herself  it was his old hitch
hikers guide to the galaxy  he had not wanted
to revisit the crash and he had not wanted the guide again  the words on the cover flashed dont panic at
him  he sat on
a rock to have a look through the old guide, and then discovered it wasnt a
rock, it was a person 

132

chapter 18  might have hurt the person he had inadver-
tently sat on or that the person he had inadvertently sat on would hurt him
back  it was so long ago and far away when
arthur had last done first aid that he really couldnt remember what it was
he was supposed to do 
you! said ford prefect 134

chapter 19  why are we sur- rounded by
squirrels, and what do they want?
ive been pestered by squirrels all night, said arthur 
thats probably it  the cy-
berminds that control them survive and start infesting the local wildlife  can
turn a whole ecosystem into some kind of helpless thrashing service industry,
handing out hot towels and drinks to passers-by  hey ho 
i didnt know, said ford, that you had a daughter 
well, theres probably a lot you dont know about me, said arthur  come
to mention it, theres probably a lot i dont know about me either  when did this happen then?
im not quite sure  is there a mother in-
volved?
trillian 
trillian? i didnt think that  im
in touch with her from time to time 
ford started to feel the side of his head again in some bemusement 

135

phroo  i was coming to pick up this parcel id sent to myself
here care of you 
well, what was that all about?
i think it may be something unimaginably dangerous  anyway, coming in at night i couldnt find this village
place  i couldnt find any signal of
any kind  i guess you dont have signals and stuff here 
thats what i like about it 
then i did pick up a faint signal from your old copy of the guide, so i homed
in on that, thinking that would take me to you  i found id landed in some
kind of wood  couldnt figure out what was going on  i go up to say hello, then suddenly i see that shes
got this thing!
what thing?
the thing i sent you! the new guide! the bird thing! you were meant
to keep it safe, you idiot, but this woman had the thing right there by her
shoulder  and when i say my ship, i mean an rw6 
a what?
an rw6 for zarks sake  ive got this great relationship going now between
my credit card and the guides central computer 
so an rw6 is a spaceship, then?
yes! its - oh never mind  i said, please for zarks
sake dont take my ship  and dont leave me stranded in the middle of some
primitive zarking forest with no medical help and a head injury 
she eases up does she?

136

chapter 19 
the sky was beginning to lighten in the west, which was where the sun rose 
arthur didnt particularly want to see it  the last thing he wanted after a
hellish night like this one was some blasted day coming along and barging
about the place  it was a bit em-
barrassing really 
you know, im an educated chap from a high-technology culture, i could show
them a thing or two  and of course i couldnt  i havent got the faintest idea,
when it comes down to it, of how anything actually works  i dont mean like
video-recorders, nobody knows how to work those  i mean just something like
a pen or an artesian well or something  not the foggiest  i couldnt help at
all  theyd never seen one before 
you didnt, for instance, find it mind-witheringly, explosively, astoundingly,
blisteringly dull?
well, er, no  not actually blisteringly 
like the pikka birds 
ford had no idea what he was talking about and couldnt be bothered to ask 
i dont think i could face going back up and over the way i came  arthur sighed a little forlornly 
i dont want to go to any blasted village! snapped ford 

137

weve got to get out of here!
where? how?
i dont know, you tell me  you live here! there must be some way off this
zarking planet 
i dont know 
oh yes? and how many spacecraft have visited this zark- forsaken little
fleapit recently?
well, a few years ago there was mine that crashed here by mistake 
ford leapt to his feet fretfully and started pacing backwards and forwards in
the feeble, painful light of the early dawn which lay streaked against the sky
as if someone had dragged a piece of liver across it 
you dont understand how important this is, he said 
what? you mean my daughter out there all alone in the galaxy? you think
i dont  please fill me in straight
away on some corporate publishing politics!
i cant tell you how much its
been on my mind of late!
you dont understand! theres a whole new guide!
oh! shouted arthur again  oh! oh! oh! im incoherent with excitement!
i can hardly wait for it to come out to find out which are the most exciting
spaceports to get bored hanging about in in some globular cluster ive never
heard of  please, can we rush to a store thats got it right this very instant?
ford narrowed his eyes 
this is that thing you call sarcasm, isnt it?
do you know, bellowed arthur, i think it is? i really think it might just
be a crazy little thing called sarcasm seeping in at the edges of my manner of
speech! ford, i have had a fucking bad night! will you please try and take
that into account while you consider what fascinating bits of badger-sputumly
inconsequential trivia to assail me with next?
try to rest, said ford 
why do you need to think? cant we just sit and go budum- budumbudum

138

chapter 19 

with our lips for a bit? couldnt we just dribble gently and loll a little bit
to the left for a few minutes? i cant stand it, ford! i cant stand all this
thinking and trying to work things out any more 
hadnt occurred to me in fact  why dont you do it again?
i did 
the first time i managed to save myself by the most astonish- ing and - i say
this in all modesty - fabulous piece of ingenious quick-thinking, agility, fancy
footwork and self-sacrifice 
what was the self-sacrifice?
i jettisoned half of a much loved and i think irreplaceable pair of shoes 
why was that self-sacrifice?
because they were mine! said ford crossly 
thats according to your  please dont tell me
why 
i fell straight into the open cockpit of a passing jet towncar whose pilot had
just accidentally pushed the eject button when he meant only to change tracks
on the stereo  now, even i couldnt think that that was particularly clever of
me  looks pretty, talks big, collapses waveforms

oh, i dont know, said arthur wearily  i expect you probably sneaked into
his jetcar the previous night and set the pilots least favourite track to play or
something  and this is the nub 
what bird?
you havent seen it?
no 
the question is, who is it really doing it for?
ive actually got a sandwich in my pocket, said arthur, delving 
its a bit squished and sodden, im afraid  whats the meat in it?
perfectly normal beast  so, the question is, ford con- tinued, who is the
bird really doing it for? whats the real game here?
mmm, ate arthur 
when i found the bird, continued ford, which i did by a series of coinci-
dences that are interesting in themselves, it put on the most fantastic multi-
dimensional display of pyrotechnics ive ever seen  thats when i decided to pack the thing up and get it
out of there  luckily for me the jetcar was there otherwise i would have had to fall

140

chapter 19 
why?
because if youve got the guide you think that you are the one its working
for  everything went swimmingly smoothly for me from then on, up to the
very moment that i come up against the totty with the rock, then, bang, im
history  im out of the loop  shes the next one in the chain who will think that
everything is going fabulously for her  she can beat whoever she likes around
the head with bits of the landscape, everything will just swim for her until
shes done whatever shes supposed to do and then it will be all up for her
too  the new guide came
out of the research labs  it made use of this new technology of unfiltered per-
ception  do you know what that means?
look, ive been making sandwiches for bobs sake!
whos bob?
never mind 
unfiltered perception means it perceives everything  got that? i dont per-
ceive everything  you dont perceive everything  the new
guide doesnt have any sense filters  it wasnt a com-
plicated technological idea  got
it?
why dont i just say that ive got it, and then you can carry on regardless  ish 
so what happens is, the bozos in the marketing and account- ing depart-
ments say, oh that sounds good, doesnt that mean we only have to make one
of them and then sell it an infinite number of times? dont squint at me like
that, arthur, this is how accountants think!
thats quite clever, isnt it?
no! it is fantastically stupid  its
got some quite clever cybertechnology in it, but because it has unfiltered per-
ception, any smallest move it makes has the power of a virus  anything can be fo-

141

cused anywhere in any of the universes that you and i move in  somewhere, there is one key
instruction, and everything else is just functions calling themselves, or brack-
ets billowing out endlessly through an infinite address space  what happens
when the brackets collapse? wheres the final end if? is any of this making
sense? arthur?
sorry, i was nodding off for a moment  you know who i think i saw at the
guide offices? vogons  i see ive said a word you understand at last 
what about it?
it isnt thunder 
what are these animals you keep on about?
i dont keep on about them 
it wasnt often that arthur had the pleasure of seeing fords eyes open wide
with astonishment 
the great thunderous herd of thousand upon thousand of perfectly normal
beasts was sweeping in magnificent array across the anhondo plain  the phalanx never moved, except that it exhibited a slight grad-
ual drift sideways and backwards for the eight or nine days that it regularly
appeared for  but though the phalanx stayed more or less constant, the great
beasts of which it was composed charged steadily at upwards of twenty miles
an hour, appearing suddenly from thin air at one end of the plain, and disap-
pearing equally abruptly at the other end  old thrashbarg had said on one occasion that some times if you
received an answer, the question might be taken away  some of the villagers
had privately said that this was the only properly wise thing theyd ever heard
thrashbarg say, and after a short debate on the matter, had put it down to
chance 
the noise of the pounding of the hooves was so intense that it was hard to144

chapter 20 
well, a lot of people are beginning to worry that space/time is showing signs
of cracking up with everything thats happening to it  there are quite a lot
of worlds where you can see how the landmasses have cracked up and moved
around just from the weirdly long or meandering routes that migrating animals
take  still, in
the absence of a decent spaceport  ford, have you ever heard of a planet called stavromula beta?
ford frowned  dont think so, he said  he pulled out his own battered old
copy of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy and accessed it 
dont know  ive only ever heard it said, and that was by someone who had
a mouthful of other peoples teeth  one of the places he claimed id got him killed was stavromula beta  it seems that this has definitely happened
at some point in time so, i suppose, i cant get killed at least until after ive
ducked on stavromula beta  ford tried a few other searches of the hitch hikers guide, but drew
a blank  no, ive never heard of it, said ford finally  ive seen the way the lamuellan hunters trap perfectly
normal beasts  its very like the way a matador
works, you know, with a brightly coloured cape 146

chapter 20 



leaping on to the back of a one-and-a-half-ton perfectly normal beast migrat-
ing through your world at a thundering thirty miles an hour is not as easy as
it might at first seem  certainly it is not as easy as the lamuellan hunters
made it seem, and arthur dent was prepared to discover that this might turn
out to be the difficult bit 
what he hadnt been prepared to discover, however, was how difficult it was
even getting to the difficult bit 
they couldnt even catch the attention of a single animal  arthur had seen what remained of any perfectly normal
beast which, as the result of a clumsy mis-throw by a young and inexperienced
lamuellan hunter, got speared while still thundering and pound- ing with the
herd  no prior appointment with death on stavromula
beta, wherever the hell stavromula beta was, would save you or anybody else
from the thunderous, mangling pounding of those hooves 148

chapter 21  they sat down, exhausted and de-
feated, and started to criticise each others technique with the towel 
youve got to flick it more, complained ford  you need more follow-through
from the elbow if youre going to get those blasted creatures to notice anything
at all  you need more supple- ness in the
wrist 
you need, said another voice, a pikka bird  they turned, and there, standing
behind them in the early morning sun, was old thrashbarg 
to attract the attention of a perfectly normal beast, he said, as he walked
forward towards them, you need a pikka bird 
from under the rough, cassocky robe-like thing he wore he drew a small pikka
bird  it sat restlessly on old thrashbargs hand and peered intently at bob
knows what darting around about three feet six inches in front of it 
ford instantly went into the sort of alert crouch he liked to do when he wasnt
quite sure what was going on or what he ought to do about it  and i wouldnt bother with
all the fancy movements  hes just as experienced a bluffer as you are  whats the bird?
its just a bird! said arthur impatiently  it lays
eggs and goes ark at things you cant see  or kar or rit or something  and ive eaten hundreds
of them  make rather a good omelette 
i dont want a zarking recipe, said ford  i just want to be sure its a real
bird and not some kind of multi-dimensional cybernightmare 
so, said old thrashbarg to arthur  aloud, he said,

149

ah, venerable thrashbarg  im afraid i think im going to have
to be popping off now  he has the aptitude, a deep love of sandwiches,
and the skills he has acquired so far, though rudimentary as yet, will, in time
mature and, er, well, i think hell work out ok is what im trying to say 
old thrashbarg regarded him gravely  he held
his arms aloft, one still carrying a bobbing pikka bird, the other his staff 
do you know, he said, i think thats the nicest thing any- bodys ever said
to me?
can we get on, please? said ford  the presence of the pikka bird at the end
of thrashbargs outstretched arm was sending tremors of interest through the
thundering herd  arthur
began to remem- ber some of the perfectly normal beast hunts he had wit-
nessed  he recalled that as well as the hunter-matadors brandishing their capes
there were always others standing behind them holding pikka birds 
old thrashbarg moved forward, a little closer to the rolling herd  some of
the beasts were now tossing their heads back with interest at the sight of the
pikka bird 
old thrashbargs outstretched arms were trembling 
only the pikka bird itself seemed to show no interest in what was going on 
now! exclaimed old thrashbarg at last  he brandished and flicked the
towel a few times, to be ready for the moment, and then he watched  head down, it was gallop-
ing towards him, right on the very edge of the herd  old thrashbarg switched
the bird, the beast looked up, tossed its head, and then, just as its head was
coming down again, arthur flourished the towel in the beasts line of sight  a few seconds later the huge thing was
standing there amongst them, snorting, panting, sweating, and sniffing excit-
edly at the pikka bird, which appeared not to have noticed its arrival at all 
with strange sort of sweeping movements of his arms old thrashbarg kept
the pikka bird in front of the beast, but always out of its reach and always
downwards  with strange sort of sweeping movements of the towel, arthur
kept drawing the beasts attention this way and that - always downwards 
i dont think ive ever seen anything quite so stupid in my life, muttered
ford to himself 
at last, the beast dropped, bemused but docile, to its knees 
go! whispered old thrashbarg urgently, to ford  go! go now!
ford leapt up on to the great creatures back, scrabbling amongst its thick
knotty fur for purchase, grasping great handfuls of the stuff to hold him steady
once he was in position 
now, sandwich maker! go! he performed some elaborate sign and ritual
handshake which arthur couldnt quite get the hang of because old thrash-
barg had obviously made it up on the spur of the moment, then he pushed
arthur forward 
old thrashbarg held the bird suddenly aloft  the beasts head swivelled up
to follow it  thrashbarg pushed upwards and upwards repeatedly with his
arms and with the pikka bird; and slowly, heavily the perfectly normal beast
lurched up off its knees and stood, at last, swaying slightly 
arthur shouted down at thrashbarg  or where theyre going?
the domain of the king! shouted old thrashbarg back  what king? the per- fectly normal
beast was swaying and rocking restlessly under him 
what do you mean, what king? shouted old thrashbarg 
what? shouted old thrashbarg  the beast fol-
lowed 
i didnt say a king, shouted old thrashbarg, i said the king 
he drew back his arm and then hurled it forward with all his strength, casting
the pikka bird up into the air above the herd  this seemed to catch the pikka
bird completely by surprise as it had obviously not been paying any attention
at all to what was going on 
go! shouted thrashbarg  go and meet your destiny, sand- wich maker!
arthur wasnt so sure about wanting to meet his destiny as such  he didnt feel at all safe up there  the beast was gathering
speed as it followed in the wake of the pikka bird  and then it was in at the
fringes of the great tide of animals, and in a moment or two, with its head
down, the pikka bird forgotten, it was running with the herd again and rapidly
approaching the point at which the herd was vanishing into thin air 
go! ride that beast! shouted thrashbarg  ride that perfectly normal beast! ride it, ride it!
ford shouted in arthurs ear, where did he say we were going?
he said something about a king, shouted arthur in return, holding on des-
perately 
what king?
thats what i said 
i didnt know there was a the king, shouted ford  and i dont suppose he meant
him  i dont know what king 

152

chapter 21 

im only saying that he couldnt possibly mean the king, so i dont know what
he means 
ford, i dont know what youre talking about  the stars, which
should have been blindingly brilliant points of light this far from the sun were
blurred and dulled by the thickness of the huge shielding bubble  perspex or
something like it 
tricia wound the tape back again to the beginning 
well, in fact, there were about a million things that were slightly odd about
it, but there was one that was nagging at her and she hadnt quite got it 
she sighed and yawned 
as she waited for the tape to rewind she cleared away some of the dirty
polystyrene coffee cups that had accumulated on the editing desk and tipped
them into the bin 
she was sitting in a small editing suite at a video production company in soho 
it was about four oclock on monday afternoon, and she had a kind of sick
feeling  she was trying to work out what the cause of this slightly sick feeling154

chapter 22 
then, being accosted by aliens on her lawn and flown to the planet rupert  seventy-five
points for a divorce or changing your hairstyle and so on 
it wasnt that the journey had been particularly stressful 
it had been ex-
tremely dull in fact 
well that was pretty astounding wasnt it? flying to the outer limits of the
solar system in the same time that it took to fly to new york meant they must
have some fantastic unheard-of form of propulsion in the ship  she quizzed
her hosts about it and they agreed that it was pretty good 
yes, persisted tricia 
like what?
warp drive, photon drive, something like that  youd have to ask the flight
engineer 
which one is he?
we dont know 
we dont know, they said, patiently 
because youve lost your minds, echoed tricia, glumly 
all of this riveting stuff was on the tape, and fine  tricia didnt know why this was,
exactly  she had a feeling that the grebulons responded to a slightly different
range of light frequencies, and that there had been a lot of ultra-violet around
which was mucking up the video camera  there were a lot of interference pat-
terns and video snow as well 
so what she had on tape, essentially, was a bunch of slightly thin and dis-
coloured people sitting around watching televisions that were showing network
broadcasts  she had also pointed the camera out of the very tiny viewport near
her seat and got a nice, slightly streaky effect of stars 
in the end she had decided to save her precious videotape for rupert itself and
had simply sat back and watched television with them 
so part of her sick feeling came from the sense that she had had all that time
in an alien spacecraft of astounding technological design, and had spent most
of it dozing in front of reruns of m*a*s*h and cagney and lacey  but what
else was there to do? she had taken some photos as well, of course, all of which
had subsequently turned out to be badly fogged when she got them back from
the chemist 
another part of her sick feeling probably came from the landing on rupert 
unfortunately, because of the angle of their approach, and the depth at which
the small thick viewport was set into the crafts skin, it hadnt been possible
to get the  but when the sun is roughly a
third of a billion miles away it doesnt do any harm 
tricia fast-forwarded  huge grey buildings under the dark canopy of the perspex
bubble  she had taken more footage of them while leaving rupert a
few hours later, just as she was about to reboard the spacecraft for the journey
home 
none of the grebulons had names, largely because they couldnt think of
any  tricia discovered that some of them had thought of calling themselves
after characters from television programmes they had picked up from earth,
but hard as they had tried to call each other wayne and bobby and chuck,
some remnant of something lurking deep in the cultural subconscious they had
brought with them from the distant stars which were their homes must have
told them that this really wasnt right and wouldnt do  he said how much he enjoyed her shows on tv, that he was her greatest
fan, how glad he was that she had been able to come along and visit them
on rupert and how much everybody had been looking forward to her coming,
how he hoped the flight had been comfortable and so on  there was no par-
ticular sense she could detect of being any kind of emissary from the stars or
anything 
certainly, watching it now on videotape, he just looked like some guy in cos-
tume and make-up, standing in front of a set that wouldnt hold up too well
if you leant against it 
how was she going to deal with it?
would she actually have to eat it? would she have access to some sort of paper
napkin she could spit stuff out into? wouldnt there be all sorts of differential
immunity problems?
it turned out to be hamburgers 
not only did it turn out to be hamburgers, but the hamburgers it turned out
to be were very clearly and obviously mcdonalds hamburgers which had been
reheated in a microwave  it wasnt just the look of them  it wasnt just the
smell 
it was the poly- styrene clamshell packages they came in which had
mcdonalds printed all over them  tricia had looked around it in bewilder-
ment that had bordered on fear but had nevertheless got it all on videotape 
the apartment had a waterbed in it  and one of those
tall electrically illuminated glass things which sit on table tops and appear to
have large globules of sperm floating about in them 
the leader lounged against a brown corduroy bean bag and squirted breath-
freshener into his mouth 
tricia began to feel very scared, suddenly 
she didnt want to make any false moves  she didnt want to alarm him 
we are a sophisticated people, we grebulons  we buy sophisticated consumer
durables 
tricia had nodded tremendously slowly at this point 

he lounged back in a relaxed fashion on his bean bag, reached for a reheated
french fry and nibbled the end of it, an amused smile playing across 
tricia could feel her brain beginning to bubble very slightly 
tricia nodded slowly again 
again, tricia realised with a cold, trickling feeling going down her spine, that
explained an awful lot 
another sick feeling began to creep over her as she watched this hopeless awful
tape, and she began, with slow horror, to realise that it must be the answer  the vodka shed had to set the sleeping pills going  there was seventeen years of obsession that a glamorous
man with two heads, one of which was disguised as a parrot in a cage, had
tried to pick her up at a party but had then impatiently flown off to another
planet in a flying saucer  new york had been, well, very hot and stress-
ful  the astrology stuff  ha! it was natures way of telling her to check

159

into an expensive medical establishment very quickly  she looked at how many large coffees shed got through
as well, and realised how heavily she was breathing and how fast 
part of solving any problem, she told herself, was realising that you had it 
she had faked it and she had no recollection of faking it or any idea of why
she had done it 
her breathing was getting hectic again as she watched the snowy, flickering
screen  she had no memory of faking
any of this very obviously fake stuff 
the person she imagined to be called the leader was ques- tioning her about
astrology and she was answering smoothly and calmly 
each of the monitors was showing a kaleidoscope of different images: a few
seconds from a game show, a few seconds from a cop show, a few seconds from
a supermarket warehouse security system, a few seconds from somebodys hol-
iday movies, a few seconds of sex, a few seconds of news, a few seconds of
comedy  it was clear that the leader was very proud of all this stuff and he
was waving his hands like a conductor while continuing at the same time to
talk complete gibberish 

puter screen showing in diagrammatic form all the planets of the solar system
and mapped out against a background of the stars in their constellations  great skills in computation, in
cosmological trigonometry, in three-dimensional navigational calculus 
obviously what happened next was that tricia quickly set the video camera
up on its tripod to capture the whole scene  she then walked into shot herself
and sat down calmly in front of the giant computer display, spent a few mo-
ments familiarising herself with the interface and then started smoothly and
com- petently to pretend that she had the faintest idea what she was doing 
it hadnt been that difficult, in fact 
she was, after all, a mathematician and astrophysicist by training and a tele-
vision presenter by experience, and what science she had forgotten over the
years she was more than capable of making up by bluffing 
the computer she was working on was clear evidence that the grebulons came
from a far more advanced and sophisticated culture than their current vacuous
state suggested, and with its aid she was able, within about half an hour, to
cobble together a rough working model of the solar system 
it wasnt particularly accurate or anything, but it looked good  the planets
were whizzing around in reasonably good simulations of their orbits, and you
could watch the movement of the whole piece of virtual cosmological clock-
work from any point within the system - very roughly  you could watch from
earth, you could watch from mars, etc  you could watch from the surface of
the planet rupert  tricia had been quite impressed with herself, but also very
impressed with the computer system she was working on  using a computer
workstation on earth the task would probably have taken a year or so of pro-
gramming 
it was you and your planets by gail andrews 

tricia stopped the tape again  the feeling that she was hal-
lucinating had now receded, but had not left anything any easier or clearer in
her head 
at a par- ty 
she had videotape, actual videotape of the most astounding story in the his-
tory of, well anything: a forgotten outpost of an alien civilisation marooned
on the outermost planet of our own solar system 
she had the videotape for gods sake 

how could she prove any of this? it wasnt even worth thinking about  her head was beginning to throb  i
dont care what it is  im busy!
when she went back in she noticed that the message light on her phone ex-
tension was winking, and wondered how long it had been on 
oh, miss mcmillan, im so glad you called  everybodys been trying to reach
you  theyre desperate to reach you  can you call them?
why didnt you put them through? said tricia 

you said i wasnt to put anybody through for anything  i didnt know what to do 
tricia! where the haemorrhaging fuck are you?
at the editing  whats up?
whats up? only a bloody alien spaceship!
what? where?
regents park 

tricia stared at it 

it wasnt a grebulon ship  not that she was suddenly an expert on extrater-
restrial craft, but this was a sleek and beautiful silver and white thing about
the size of a large ocean-going yacht, which is what it most resembled  next to
this, the structures of the huge half-dismantled grebulon ship looked like gun
turrets on a battleship  thats what those blank grey buildings
had looked like  and what was odd about them was that by the time she
passed them again on her way to reboarding the small grebulon craft, they
had moved  these things flitted briefly through her head as she ran from the
taxi to meet her camera crew 
wheres the girl? she shouted above the noise of helicopters and police
sirens  she says her mother and father came from here in some parallel
dimension or something like that, and shes got her fathers watch, and  i
dont know  what can i tell you? busk it 
thanks a lot, ted, muttered tricia, checked that her mike was securely
clipped, gave the engineer some level, took a deep breath, tossed her hair back
and switched into her role of pro- fessional reporter, on home ground, ready
for anything 
mother! she screamed, and started to hurl rocks at tricia 
jump! shouted ford prefect 
what did you say? shouted arthur again, and then realised that ford
prefect was no longer there 
realising he couldnt hold on any longer he pushed himself sideways as hard
as he could and rolled into a ball as he hit the ground, rolling, rolling away
from the pounding hooves  he hadnt had a day as bad as this since the earth had been blown up 
he didnt know what from or what to, but running away seemed a prudent
move 
he ran straight into ford prefect who was standing there surveying the scene 
it didnt look much like the domain of a king, or the king, or any kind of
king  the dusty earth was packed
hard and had neatly bruised every last bit of arthur that hadnt already been
bruised by the festivities of the previous night  some way ahead of them were
great cliffs that looked like sandstone, eroded by the wind and what little rain
presumably fell in those parts into wild and fantastic shapes, which matched
the fantastic shapes of the giant cacti that sprouted here and there from the
arid, orange landscape  they
swept up in their tens of thousands from the far horizon, disappeared com-
pletely for about half a mile, then swept off, thundering and pounding to the
distant horizon opposite 
then there were the spaceships parked in front of the bar &amp; grill 
in fact only one of the spaceships was parked in front of the domain of the
king bar &amp; grill  wild fins all over it, far, far too much chrome all over the fins
and most of the actual
bodywork painted in a shocking pink  it crouched there like an immense brood-
ing insect and looked as if it was at any moment about to jump on something
about a mile away 
the domain of the king bar &amp; grill was slap bang in the middle of
where the perfectly normal beasts would be charging if they didnt take a mi-
nor transdimensional diversion on the way  a truckstop diner  thats not like you 
there hadnt been a lot of noise before, but there was defi- nitely a kind of
silence now  he was leaning against the bar at an extravagantly relaxed an-
gle  some people would say there were exactly three, but it
wasnt that kind of a place, not the kind of a place that you felt like being that
specific in 
the barman was not moving very swiftly to get in fords order  in fact he
wasnt moving at all 
taint mine to sell, said the barman 
so, whose?
the barman nodded at the big guy setting up on the stage  big fat guy, mov-
ing slow, balding  the beer was pretty good and made
him a little sleepy which he didnt mind at all  he exchanged a few professional
roll-making remarks with the barman and just let ford get on with whatever
ford wanted to do 
the barman was very surprised  hes selling it to you?
hes giving it to us for free, said ford, taking a gnaw at his roll 

reflectively, its at times like this that you kind of wonder if its worth wor-
rying about the fabric of space/time and the causal integrity of the multi-
dimensional probability matrix and the potential collapse of all wave forms in
the whole sort of general mish mash and all that sort of stuff thats been
bugging me 
the barman, who had been silent for a moment or two, said, you say hes
letting you have his ship?
yeah, said ford  but then you think of guys like infinidim enterprises and you
think, they are not going to get away with it  the barman fell over amongst the bottles and glasses 
ford vaulted quickly over the bar to check that he was all right and help him
back up to his feet  hed cut his finger and his elbow a bit and was feeling a
little woozy but was otherwise fine  the barman
hobbled off with fords credit card to get authorisation 
is there stuff going on here that i dont know about? said arthur to ford 
isnt there usually? said ford  shouldnt we
be going? he said suddenly 
thats where random will be going! said arthur with a start  er 
ford let arthur get on with thinking things out for himself while he got out
his old edition of the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy  will the
earth be there or not there? i spent so much time look- ing for it  all i found
was planets that were a bit like it or not at all like it, though it was clearly the

167

right place because of the continents  the worst version was called nowwhat
where i got bitten by some wretched little animal  thats how they commu-
nicated, you know, by biting each other  then half the time,
of course, the earth isnt even there because its been blown up by the bloody
vogons  how much sense am i making?
ford didnt comment  the earth is there! thats
where random will be going! the bird was showing her the earth in the rain-
storm!
ford motioned arthur to shout a little less loudly  hed heard bar singers sing love me tender
before  the singer was quite good, as bar singers
went, if you liked that sort of thing, but arthur was getting fretful  him that he didnt have
his watch any more 
dont you think we should be going? he said, insistently  hed never seen ford moved by
anything other than very, very strong drink 
anyway, ford whispered, ive got to review the restaurant 
write a review? of this place?
filing the review validates the expenses claim  ive fixed it so that it happens
completely automatically and untraceably 
i dont know how much that is, said arthur  whats it worth in pounds
sterling? what would it buy you?
it would probably buy you, roughly  er 

up his hitch hikers guide and started to type  this
isnt going to take long, is it? he said  just mention that the rolls were quite good,
the beer good and cold, local wildlife nicely eccentric, the bar singer the best
in the known universe, and thats about it  doesnt need much  just a vali-
dation  the barman was returning with a piece of paper, which
seemed to be trembling in his hand 
he pushed it over to ford with a kind of nervous, reverential twitch 
funny thing, said the barman  then
suddenly its, oh yeah, thats ok, and the system  er, validates it  this is going to hurt
infinidim a lot, he said, with an appearance of concern 
he signed with a flourish and handed it back to the barman 
more money, he said, than the colonel made for him in an entire career of
doing crap movies and casino gigs  the barman pushed them away 
i dont think thats necessary, he said, slightly hoarsely 
tis to me, said ford  ok, we are outa here  you dont think its a bit overdone, do you?
he said it again when they climbed inside it  the seats and quite a lot of the
controls were covered in fine fur skin or suede  there was a big gold monogram
on the main control panel which just read ep 
you know, said ford as he fired up the ships engines, i asked him if it was
true that he had been abducted by aliens, and you know what he said?

169

who? said arthur 
which king? oh, weve had this conversation, havent we?
never mind, said ford 
im still not sure who were talking about, said arthur 
why dont you choose some music and put it on?
ok, said arthur, and flipped through the cartons 



the news networks dont like this kind of thing  another completely different
one arrives three and a half hours later and somehow it isnt  the third spacecraft, half an hour after that, the little four berth
hrundi runabout, only made it on to the local news  they min- gled briefly with the crowd that gathered round
to ogle, then said loudly that if no one else was going to call the police they
would, and made good their escape 
oh dont get all maudlin on me, snapped ford 

they checked into a large two-bedroomed suite at the langham  i want to order up some margaritas please  couple of chefs salads  and as much foie gras as youve got 
shes on the news! shouted arthur from the next room 
thats what i said, said ford into the phone 
shes  do you know who shes being inter-
viewed by?
are you having difficulty understanding the english lan- guage? continued
ford  i dont care if its closed this
evening  i dont want to buy a ticket, i just want to buy the zoo  i dont care
if youre busy  this is room service, im in a room and i want some service  heres what i want you to do  set up some good teams of
people to monitor their progress in the wild, see that theyre doing ok  er 
it seems to be a different
trillian  its tricia mcmillan which is what trillian used to be called before 
er  why dont you come and watch, see if you can figure it out?
just a second, ford shouted, and returned to his negotia- tions with room
service 
we might need to buy somewhere like zaire and maybe some islands  mada-
gascar  well need a wide variety
of habitats  look, l dont see why youre seeing this as a problem  i think youll find my credit
is good 
i ordered us some foie gras, said ford 
i said i ordered us some foie gras  um, i always feel a hit bad about foie gras  bit
cruel to the geese, isnt it?
fuck em, said ford, slumping on the bed 
well, thats all very well for you to say, but  if you dont like it ill have yours  whats happening?
chaos! said arthur  complete chaos! random keeps on screaming at tril-
lian, or tricia or whoever it is, that she aban- doned her and then demanding

173

to go to a good night club  tricias broken down in tears and says shes never
even met random let alone given birth to her  then she suddenly started
howling about someone called rupert and said that he had lost his mind or
something  i didnt quite follow that bit, to be honest  then random started
throwing stuff and theyve cut to a commercial break while they try and sort
it all out  oh! theyve just cut back to the studio! shut up and watch 
a rather shaken anchorman appeared on the screen and apologised to viewers
for the disruption of the previous item  he said he didnt have any very clear
news to report, only that the mysterious girl, who called herself random fre-
quent flyer dent had left the studio to, er, rest  tricia mcmillan would be, he
hoped, back tomorrow  meanwhile, fresh reports of ufo activity were coming
in 
ford leaped up off the bed, grabbed the nearest phone and jabbed at a num-
ber 
concierge? you want to own the hotel? its yours if you can find out for me
in five minutes which clubs tricia mcmillan belongs to 



away in the inky depths of space invisible movements were being made 
invisible to any of the inhabitants of the strange and tem- peramental plural
zone at the focus of which lay the infinitely multitudinous possibilities of the
planet called earth, but not inconsequential to them 
at the very edge of the solar system, hunkered down on a green leatherette
sofa, staring fretfully at a range of tv and computer screens sat a very worried
grebulon leader  fiddling with his book on as-
trology  fiddling with the console of his computer  fiddling with the displays
being fed through to him constantly from all of the grebulons monitoring
devices, all of them focused on the planet earth  they certainly had a lot of other equipment with them that must
have had some purpose if only they hadnt accidentally lost all trace of their
purpose  he needed a sense of purpose in life, which was why he had turned
to astrology to fill the yawning gulf that existed in the middle of his mind and
soul 
it was telling him, as far as he could make out, that he was about to have a
very bad month, that things were going to go from bad to worse if he didnt
get a grip on things and start making some positive moves and thinking things
out for himself  it was very clear from his star chart which he had worked out using
his astrology book and the computer program which that nice tricia mcmillan
had designed for him to re-triangulate all the appropriate astronomical data 
earth-based astrology had to be entirely recalculated to yield results that were
meaningful to the grebulons here on the tenth planet out on the frozen edges176

chapter 25 
the recalculations showed absolutely clearly and unamhigu- ously that he was
going to have a very bad month indeed, starting with today  because today
earth was starting to rise into capricorn, and that, for the grebulon leader,
who showed all the character signs of being a classic taurus, was very bad
indeed  this was all very
difficult for him, but he knew that nobody ever said that doing tough stuff
wasnt tough  the com- puter was already tracking and predicting the second-
by-second location of the planet earth 

because all of the grebulon surveillance equipment was focused on the
planet earth, it failed to spot that there was now another source of data in
the solar system 
its chances of spotting this other source of data - a massive yellow constructor
ship - accidentally were practically nil  it was as far from the sun as rupert
was, but almost diametrically opposite, almost hidden by the sun 
the massive yellow constructor ship wanted to be able to monitor events on
planet ten without being spotted itself 
there were all sorts of other ways in which this ship was diametrically opposite
to the grebulons 
anyone who knew of his purpose might have said that it was a pointless and
ugly one, that it wasnt the sort of purpose that enhanced a life, put a spring
in a persons step, made birds sing and flowers bloom 
it wasnt his job to worry about that, though 
if that led to a certain narrowness of vision and
circularity of thought then it wasnt his job to worry about such things 
many, many light years from here, indeed from anywhere, lies the grim and
long abandoned planet, vogsphere  some- where on a fetid, fog-bound mud
bank on this planet there stands, surrounded by the dirty, broken and empty
carapaces of the last few jeweled scuttling crabs, a small stone monument

177

which marks the place, where it is thought, the species vogon vogonblurtus
first arose 
deep in the bowels of his unsightly yellow ship, the vogon captain grunted as
he reached for a slightly faded and dog-eared piece of paper that lay in front
of him 
one of the troublesome circumstances was the plural nature of this galactic
sector, where the possible continually interfered with the probable  simple
demolition didnt get you any further than pushing down a bubble under a
badly hung strip of wallpaper 
the third was an irritating and anarchic little device called the hitch hikers
guide to the galaxy  dim lights danced briefly in the black eyes of
the bird as, deep in its instructional address space, bracket after bracket was
final- ly closing, if clauses were finally ending, repeat loops halting, recursive
functions calling themselves for the last few times 
with a flatulent noise of satisfaction, the vogon captain sat back to watch 

178

chapter 25 



just there, number forty-two, shouted ford prefect to the taxi-driver  they had
stopped at quite a number of cash-dispensers on the way, and ford chucked a
fistful of money through the window at the driver  members knew where it was, and if you werent a mem-
ber then knowing where it was wasnt any help to you 
ford prefect was not a member of stavros though he had once been to stavros
other club in new york  he had a very simple method of dealing with estab-
lishments of which he was not a member  he simply swept in as soon as the
door was opened, pointed back at arthur and said, its ok, hes with me 
he bounded down the dark glossy stairs, feeling very froody in his new shoes 
they were suede and they were blue, and he was very pleased that in spite
of everything else going on he had been sharp-eyed enough to spot them in a
shop window from the back of a speeding taxi 

yes, i think so, said the man and swayed slightly and dropped the book of
matches hed been carrying 
excuse me, he said, im trying desperately to remember which drug ive
just taken, but it must be one of those ones which mean you cant remember 
he shook his head and turned away again, and went up towards the mens
room  he hurried on downstairs, with arthur following ner-
vously in his wake  the encounter had shaken him badly and he didnt know
why 
he didnt like places like this  for all of the dreams of earth and home he had
had for years, he now badly missed his hut on lamuella with his knives and
his sandwiches  he even missed old thrashbarg  up the stairs behind him he saw trillian hurrying
down towards him in her wonderfully rumpled rymplon tm  no - this was tricia  tricia
that he had just seen, hysterical with confusion, on television  behind her in the recesses of
the smart, dimly lit club, the other clientele of the evening formed a frozen
tableau, staring anxiously up at the confrontation on the stairs  only the music from behind the
bar didnt know to stop throbbing 
the gun she is holding, said ford quietly, nodding slightly towards random,
is a wabanatta 3  just dont move for a moment  lets just everybody stay calm and
find out whats upsetting her  her other hand delved into her pocket and pulled out the
remains of arthurs watch 
i thought i would fit here, she cried, on the world that made me! but it
turns out that even my mother doesnt know who i am! she flung the watch
violently aside, and it smashed into the glasses behind the bar, scattering its
innards 
random, said trillian quietly from up on the stairs  you abandoned me!

181

random, it is very important that you listen to me and understand, per-
sisted trillian quietly  there isnt very much time 
listen, said trillian again 
listen! please listen! a reconnaissance battleship had failed
to turn up, the rest of the fleet was scattered in some farcical disarray 
i dont care! i dont want to hear about your bloody job! shouted random  you dont
have one  the people of that ship dont have a
home  they dont know where they are from  they dont even have any mem-
ory of who they are or what they are for  perhaps there
isnt anywhere  can
we go?
random was wavering in panic and confusion  if im here, were safe  dont ask me to
explain just now, but i am safe, so you are safe  ok?
what are you saying? said trillian 
the door to the mens room at the top of the stairs opened, and the man who
had accosted arthur came out, sniffing  there was a deafening explo- sion  he fell awk-
wardly as trillian threw herself down over him 

look of utter stupefaction  im sorry! she
said  im so sorry! im so, so sorry 
tricia went to her  trillian went to her  it looked like this:

he stared at it for some time as things began slowly to reassemble them-
selves in his mind 
through the new strangeness of noise and light he could just make out the
shape of ford prefect sitting back and laughing wildly 

in the darkness of the bridge at the heart of the vogon ship, prostetnic
vogon jeltz sat alone  in the air above him the discontinuities in the blue and
green watery sausage shape resolved themselves  the vogon captain sat immersed in it for a
few seconds 
the vogon turned on the light himself  his ship slunk
off into the inky void 

in spite of having taken what he regarded as an extremely positive piece
of action, the grebulon leader ended up having a very bad month after all
