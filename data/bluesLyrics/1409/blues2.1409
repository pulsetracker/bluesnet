Man those bedbugs sure is evil : he sure don't mean me no good
He thinks I'm a woodpecker : and he taken me for a chunk of wood
When I lay down at night : and I wonder how can a poor man sleep
When one holding your hand : while the other one eating your feet
Bedbugs big as a jackass : he will bite you and stand and grin
*Think you pull the bedbug apart* : come back and bite you again
Someone moaning in the corner : Lord I tried so hard to see
It was a mother bedbug : Lord praying for some more to eat
I have to sit up all night long : my feet can't touch the floor
Because the mean old bedbug : told me I can't live there no more

Sarah Lee : why don't you come home

My mama told me : when I was a child
Good time now : trouble after a while
If I had a-listened : to what my mother said
I wouldn't be in here : treated this a-way
I'd rather see my coffin : roll in front of my door
Than to hear my good gal : say I don't want you no more
I dreamt last night : the world was caving in
Wasn't nothing at all : my girl coming home again
I feel like jumping : from the treetop to the ground
The girl I love : she sure done put me down

But any time that you're broke : your good friends they can't be found
When I lost all my money : no one would loan me a dime
I could hear them all saying : he ain't no friend of mine
It's tough when you're broke friends : you can't even get a dime
If you even go a-begging : everyone will turn you down
I'm going back to prison : don't know what else to do
That's the only thing I know : to cure a prisoner's blues

My name is Piggly Wiggly : I've got groceries on my shelf
Getting mighty tired : making these nights all by myself
My mama told me : my papa told me too
Don't let these Cadillac women : make no flat tire out of you
If I had a-listened : to what my mama said
Wouldn't have had such a hard time : in this world today
I don't want no woman : wants to rove these streets night and day
A woman like that : always wants to have her way
I'm leaving you now mama : baby baby bye bye
Going to miss your daddy : cuddling by your cozy side

Sometime : my woman too sweet to die
And again I believe : ought to be buried alive
Oh : babe it hurts me to my heart
But the Good Book says : that the best of friends must part
Because I'm black : I was born black 'fore my birth
And the women do tell me : I'm the sweetest black man on earth
And : baby what's the matter now
I'll always remember : you don't mean me no good nohow
Oh : baby what's the matter you
You worry me woman : babe I don't know what to do

Treated me like I was a doggone king : and she was a doggone queen
Going up the country : mama don't you want to go
May take me a fair brown : may take one or two more
Big Eighty left Savannah : Lord it did not stop
You ought to see that colored fireman : when he got them boiler hot
You can reach over in the corner mama : and hand me my traveling shoes
You know by that : I've got them Statesboro blues

Come into Atlanta : to get a chance
Grab your mama : and hold her tight
Let's mess around : the rest of the night
Grip your head : way up high
Grab your daddy : and make him cry
People come : from miles around
Get in Dark Town : to break them down
Down in dark town : night and day
Trying to dance : them blues away
Go all the way back : to Newport News
Singing : these doggone Atlanta blues

I want you to start in the morning baby : and roll me with the setting of the sun

I want you to keep it all for your daddy : and don't give nobody none

And if you get some of my loving : you won't want your rider no more

You don't have to worry about your loving : I'm a deep-sea diver and I don't go wrong

That's why I'm singing : these barrelhouse woman blues

You may search the ocean : you might go across the deep blue sea
But mama you'll never find : another hot-shot like me
I followed my baby : from the station to the train
And the blues came down : like doggone showers of rain
I left her at the station : wringing her hands and crying
I told her she had a home : just as long as I got mine
I've got two women : and you can't tell them apart
I got one in my bosom : the other one in my heart
The one in my bosom : she's in Tennessee
And the one in my heart : don't even give a darn for me
I used to say a married woman : was the sweetest woman ever was born
But I've changed that thing : you better let married women alone
Take my advice : let these married women be
Because their husbands'll grab you : and beat you ragged as a cedar tree
When a woman say she love you : about as good as she do herself
I don't pay her no attention : tell that same lie to somebody else
I really don't believe : no woman in the whole round world do right
Act like an angel in the daytime : ??? at night
I'm going pretty mama : please don't break this rule
That's why : I'm searching these deserts for the blues
I'm going pretty mama : searching these deserts now
That's why : I'm walking my baby home anyhow

I've got a man : works on the railroad track
The reason he keeps his job : he can squat it in the sack
He's not so good-looking : he don't dress so fine
But when he does his squatting : he really takes his time
Now I want you to go ahead on girls : and leave him alone
That's the very reason : scared to trust him at home
That's the man : he's scared to call his name
Because when he go to squatting : it's a crying shame
He not so short : he not so tall
But when he's doing the squatting : you might a-hear me squall

And you don't *store* it to me : that's what makes my happiness
I'm not lying baby : you were always really mine
And if I don't see you soon : I'll sure be found crying
Right back to Dallas : I got to be on my way
I'm going to let that Texas Special : drop me in southern U S A

I don't know that she loves me : but still she calls me her southpaw

If you don't see me tomorrow : you won't have no man at all
Baby if I had wings : like a bullfrog on a pond
I would ride right here : and land in sweet mama's arms
Lord said blues jumped a rabbit : run him for a solid mile

Black cat crawls late hours at midnight : nightmares ride till the break of day
What the use of loving some woman : some man done stole your love away
Stop your crying : do away with all your tears
If you can't stay with me mother : it must have been your time to leave from here

She would be most sweet and true to me : if I could go to her home
Blues and trouble : two things I've had all my life
I never had so much trouble : till I fell in love with another man's wife
What's the use of getting sober : know you're going to be drunk again
What's the use of leaving your mama : know you're going to beg back home again
She's so evil : baby you know you can't clown
Because you can't never tell : when your husband is around
Tell me what's the matter mama : can't see no mail
Post office on fire : mailman in jail
I'm going to call you one morning : please don't forget that day
If you can't do like I tell you : mama go on your no-good way

My father my brother : the man that wrecked my life
It may be a week : it may be a month or two
But the day you quit me honey : it's coming home to you
I've got the world in a jug : the stopper's in my hand
I'm going to hold it : until you men come under my command

When every friend I had : is done shook hands and gone
You better stop your man : from tickling me under my chin
Because if he keeps on tickling : I'm sure going to *beg* him on in

Than to see my man : starting in to pack his trunk

He stole my money : and he pawned my clothes
And which a-way my daddy went : the Gypsy only knows

The blues dropped on those willow leaves : and it rolled right down on me
I went up on the mountain : high as any gal could stand
And looked down on that engine : that took away my loving man
I heard the whistle blowing : the fireman ring the bell
They taking away that willow tree : that give me this weeping spell
When you broken-hearted : and your man is out of town
Go to the river : take a chair and sit down
And if he don't come back to you : I tell you what to do
Just jump right overboard : because he ain't no more to you
Folks I love my man : I kiss him morning noon and night
I wash his clothes and keep him clean : and try to treat him right
Now he's gone and left me : after all I tried to do
The way he treats me girls : he'll do the same thing to you

When the high browns get together : it's just too tight
They all congregates there : in an all night strut
And what they do : is tut tut tut
Old Hannah Brown : from cross town
Gets full of corn : and starts breaking them down
Check all your razors : and your guns
We going to be arrested : when the wagon comes
Check all your razors : and your guns
Do the shim-sham-shimmy : till the rising sun

You give me such a thrill : you make my thermometer rise
Daddy you as sweet as you can be : when you take me for a buggy ride
When you get me down upon your knee : and ask me to be your bride
When you hug and kiss me : it makes me feel fine
I gets this funny feeling : up and down my spine
Your loving ain't so *fordy* : in the park
But you a loving *cold* creature : in the dark
You ain't so hot : what can it be
What makes me say : daddy take all of me
You always ready : every time that I call
What I like about you : you never stall
You ain't no creature : you a good old soul
You done sent salvation : to my very soul

I done cried so much : look like I got the mumps
I can't keep from worrying : because I'm down in the dumps
I had a nightmare last night : when I lay down
When I woke up this morning : my sweet man couldn't be found
I'm going down to the river : into it I'm going to jump
Can't keep from worrying : because I'm down in the dumps
Someone knocked on my door : last night when I was asleep
I thought it was that sweet man of mine : making his 'fore-day creep
'Twas nothing but my landlord : a great big chump
Stay away from my door Mr landlord : because I'm down in the dumps
When I woke up : my pillow was wet with tears
Just one day from that man of mine : seem like a thousand years
But I'm going to straighten up : *straight as a answer come*
Ain't no use of telling me that lie : because I'm down in the dumps
I'm twenty-five years old : that ain't no maid
I got plenty of vim and vitality : I'm sure that I can make the grade
I'm always like a tiger : I'm ready to jump
I need a whole lots of loving : because I'm down in the dumps

Digging and a-hauling : hauling that Birmingham coal
Many times I wondered : when they put my daddy down
Will he come back to me : will they leave him in the ground
Something like the pitcher : that they sent down in the well
Wondering will they break it : Lordy Lordy who can tell
It was late one evening : I was standing at that mine
Foreman said : my daddy had gone down for his last last time
How he was a coal miner : from his hat down to his shoes
And I'm nearly dying : with these mining camp blues

Now when you lay down at night : call your good friend by name
You don't like my *teepee* : you sure can't make my
And I looked at the sun : and the sun was shining warm
You never miss your good gal : till you caught your train and gone
And you stood and cried : what you want me to say to you
I want you to think about the things baby : that me and you used to do
Honey run here baby : let's join our good hands
I been in trouble some place : gal ever since I been your man
If the blues don't quit me : I'll stay drunk every day
The last time I seen you : trying to make your get-away

I've got the worried blues : Lord I'm feeling bad
I've got no one: tell my troubles to
You can box me up : and send me to my ma
If my ma don't want me : send me to my pa
If my pa don't want me : send me to my girl

If my girl don't want me : cast me in the sea
So the fish and the whales : make a fuss all over me
I'm going to build me : a heaven of my own
I'm going to give : all good-time women a home
Get your hat and your coat : get shaking it all down the line


Now fare thee my honey : fare thee

Strange things have happened : that never before
My baby told me : I would have to go
Feel bad this morning : ain't got no home
No use a-worrying : because the world's gone wrong
I told you baby : right to your head
If I don't leave you : I would have to kill you dead
I tried to be loving : and treat you kind
But it seems that now : I got no loving mind
If you have a woman : and she don't do kind
Pray to the good Lord : to get her off your mind
Said when you been good now : can't do no more
Just tell her nicely : there is a front door
Pack up my suitcase : give me my hat
No use asking me babe : because I'll never be back

 Grabbed me a sister : to convert her soul
 Two minutes later : preacher came in
 She stopped rolling with me : started rolling with him
 I took my cow : to the doctor man
 Something about her : I couldn't understand
