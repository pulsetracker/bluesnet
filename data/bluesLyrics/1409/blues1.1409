I said look a-here mama : what in the world are you trying to do
You want to make me love you : you going to break my heart in two
I said you don't want me : what made you want to lie
Now the day you quit me fair brown : baby that's the day you die
I'd rather see you dead : buried in some cypress grove
Than to hear some gossip mama : that she had done you so
It was early one morning : just about the break of day
And along brownskin coming : man and drove me away
Lord my baby quit me : she done set my trunk outdoors
That put the poor boy wandering : Lord along the road
I said trouble here mama : and trouble everywhere you go
And it's trouble here mama : baby good gal I don't know

I got something I'm going to tell you : mama keep it all to yourself
Don't you tell your mama : don't you tell nobody else
I'm going to write you a letter : I'm going to mail it in the air
Then I know you going to catch it : babe in this world somewhere
I'm going to write you a letter : I'm going to mail it in the sky
Mama I know you going to catch it : when the wind blows on the line
Ooh : mama I don't know what to do
I knows you'll go : leave me all lowdown and blue
Ooh : that's the last word you said
And I just can't remember : babe last old words you said

Don't you let nobody : tear the barrelhouse down
And I fold my arms : and I begin to walk away
I said that's all right sweet mama : your trouble's going to come some day

Now there's trouble trouble : I been having all my days
Now it seems like troubles : going to put me in my lonesome grave
Now my woman she got ways : just like a wildcat in the woods
She always raising hell and disturbance : right here in my neighborhood
I'm scared to stay here : scared to leave this old bad-luck town
So when I wake up every morning : my head is going round and round
Now listen here people : I don't want no one's advice
I done changed my way of living : going to find someone to treat me right
I'm going to tell everybody : what bad luck I've had in my life
I'd kill my sister and my brother : not a woman *break my line*

Every time I want to leave : I know she's got to come back home
Now you said that you loved me : what make you treat me so unkind
You just old hard-headed woman : but I believe you about to lose your mind
Now you can tell your kid-man : he needn't take it so doggone hard
Because if he messes with me : going to crack him right on his nog

And my poor mother's old : Lord and her hair is turning grey
I know it would break her heart : if she found I was barrelhousing this way
And I'm going to where : now the water drink like wine
Where I can be drunk there : and staggering all the time
And it ain't but the one thing now : Lord that worries my mind

And my friend passed me : and she never said a word
Nothing I had did : but was something she had heard

And that is why : you never see poor Lottie smile
My heart aches so : I can't be satisfied
I believe : I'll take a train and ride

Because I miss my cruel daddy : from my side
I've got Cadillac ways : got some super ideas

Going to fix it : I won't have to drift no more

Oh the black cat told the white one : let's go across town and clown
And the white cat told the black one : you better set your black self down
Tell me baby : where did you get your sugar from

Now it was old lady *Diana* : was sitting on the rock
Along flew a bumblebee : and raised a great big knot
Tell me bumblebee : when did you fly from home
Oh you ain't done no stinging : on the boodie-bum
You know the baby kitten jumped up : oh and began to wine
You know he didn't know the racket : but he had the same thing on his mind
Tell me baby sister : where did you get your sugar from

Tight like that : and shake that thing
I ask her about it : she said before long
Let's get together : because your water's on
Let's get started : be long gone
Let's get together : what you waiting on
I saw you mama : way last spring
Eyeballs shining : like a diamond ring
Staggered down the street : hollering and a-fussing
I tried to stop her : and I got a good cussing
I saw your mama : your papa too
What they was doing : just won't do
I slipped up on them : and took one look
What they was doing : wasn't in the book
If you want some loving : you want it cheap
Go down on Ellsworth : about the middle of the week
Show them girls a quarter : they won't let you go
It's four or five times : and then some more

When the blues creep up on you : and carry your mind away
While I lay in my bed : and cannot go to sleep
While my heart's in trouble : and my mind is thinking deep
My mind was running : back to days of long ago
And the one I love : I don't see her anymore
Blues why do you worry me : why do you stay so long
You come to me yesterday : been with me all night long

I did not have no blues : but little mama just wasn't satisfied
It's pull on your race horse : bet on your derby too
I ain't got nobody in this world : will do love me true
And I locked in the death cell : and drop my weary head and cried
I told the sing sing prison board : this ain't like being outside
And if if hadn't been for you little mama : I wouldn't not been here
I drinking wine and whiskey : mama and your home-brewed beer

You're like an old ship : that sprung a leak
You ain't young no more : and your loving is weak

With dice you lose your money : with your man you lose your life

All dolled up : looking keen
Like a girlie : in her teens
Strutting : down the avenue
Making eyes : and flirting too
Now the other night : when I phoned
You had another : in your home
Parts of me : big and fat
Can't blame nobody : for that
I want your love : I can't refuse
But I don't want it : if it's ever been used
Some is tall : some is cute
Some is sweet : and some is true
I don't mean : to speak so bold
Can't use it : if it's forty years old

Something pounding : in my breast
When I lay down : to take my rest
Horrid nightmares : scary dreams
Then the blues : steps on the scene
Oh maybe it's the blues : that keeps me worried all the time
If I could lose these weary blues : that's on my mind
Happiness that comes around : but never comes to stay
If I only had someone : just to drive my tears away

You can ever so much money : and friends of different kinds
But to find someone to love you : I swear they're hard to find
If you should find someone to love you : someone to treat you right
You must be kind and loving : and don't run around at night
Because a woman's very funny : she wants you around her all the time
And find you's been gone : some old rounder might change her mind
Don't you never believe : your woman thinks too much of you
Because there's always been some good man : to beat you doing what you're trying to do

If you mistreat a good woman : she'll turn her back on you
If your woman loves you : she'll stand by you to the end
Nobody can steal your place : you can leave her with a bunch of men
If you get a jealous-hearted woman : be careful what you do
Because there's always somebody : tell her lies on you

The graveyard is lonely : you better put brakes on yourself
Because that's just where you're going : if I catch you with anyone else
It's a hard pill to swallow : when the neighbors all bring you the news
They say you drinks in the alley : on corners or any place you choose
If you don't treat me no better : I ain't going to be your man no more
I love you it's true : but I will have to let you go
If you don't want to tell your mother : that you soon will be coming home
You better cut out you late hours : and let other mens alone
You drinks way too much whiskey : you ain't got no stopping point
And as soon as all the taverns close : you then head for some moonshine joint

Well you dreamed you had a dollar : and your woman's got another man

She left this town with a teasing brown : and her name was Mandy White
I'm leaving town : today
When I find that gal : this what I'm going to say
You can have my money : all I want is the facts
I ain't got no time to lose : I got to hurry on back
When I find that aggravated papa : who tried to two-time me
I know I serve a great long sentence : in the penitentiary
I'm going to buy me a gun : airplane and a submarine
I'm going to kill everybody : ever treat me mean

When you were down : sick down on your bed
Know bobby brought you your medicine : also brought you bread
You is up today : looking good again
I knocked on your door : wouldn't even let me in
But the sun going to shine : once more in my back door
It's true I love you sweet mama : but you can't mistreat me no more
I was standing at the terminal : arms fold up and cried
Crying I wonder what train : taking that brown of mine
And I run to the telephone : took the receiver down
I said hello Central : give me Doctor Brown
My baby looks for me : at any old hour at night
No matter when I go there : she's never turning off her light
Mmm : Lord Lord Lord
You womens in Atlanta : treat your men like your dog

Been gone long enough : to take you to your good gal home
Tell my wild women in California : where I so long to be
Wild women and whiskey : can make a fool out of me
They can lead me like a little airedale : that's only seven weeks old
They can lead me to the water : shake my head no no no
The longest train I ever rode : was seventy-nine coaches long
But if the man had a-seed me : around the mountain I'd have been gone

What it done to me : spoiled me the rest of my life
I thought it was a squirrel : I took him into my camp
When I put him down : all my clothes was damp
All the people around me : they give me plenty of air
It was so doggone strong : I sniffled it everywhere
I never smelled a smell : that smelled so doggone bad
It was the worst old smell : baby I ever had
I jumped into the water : I scrubbed scrubbed scrubbed scrubbed
But I smelled stronger : baby the harder I rubbed
It was a doggone polecat : and he [sure] ain't no friend of mine
He as pretty as a white dog : but he ain't worth a doggone dime

For to poison her father and her mother : in the coffeepot
Then they carried the remains : throwed it out in the *shore*

Left Cincinnati : about half past nine
Got to Newport News : before dinner time
Now Casey Jones said : before he died
He fixed the road : so a bum could ride
And if he ride : he have to ride the rod
Rest his heart : in the hand of God
Now little girl says : mama is that a fact
Papa got killed : on the I C track
Yes yes honey : but hold your breath
Get that money : from your daddy's death
When the news reached town : Casey Jones was dead
Women went home : and *had it* out in red
Slipping and sliding : all across the streets
With their loose mother hubbard : and their stocking feet
Now Casey Jones : went from place to place
Another train hit his train : right in the face
People got off : but Casey Jones stayed on

Standing at the station : watch my baby leave town
I feel disgusted : no peace can be found
Now you can hear the whistles blowing : but I just can't see no train
Way down in my heart : got a lot of aches and pains
Sometime I feel disgusted : and I feel so blue
I hardly know what in this world baby : a good man can do
If I could holler : just like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain : and call my baby back
Some day you're going to be sorry : you ever done me wrong
It'll be too late darling : your man will be gone
My mind goes to wondering : I feel so bad
Thinking about the trouble : a good man always have

Now I'm doing the lock-step baby : things ain't going so nice
It don't matter to me : whether it sunshine snow or rains
Because I can't go gay cutting : and carry a ball and chain
Mean old jailor : taking away my dancing shoes
I can't strut my stuff : when I got those lock-step blues
Big rats in my cell : keeps me woke all night
My woman done turned me down : and I don't think that's right
Every morning : I walk down that big long hall
I'm screaming for my mama : can't make no time at all

Hang me in the morning : and cut me down at night
Well the mean old hangman : he went and tightened up that noose
Lord I'm so scared : I am trembling in my shoes
[Jury, jurymen] heard my case : and it said my hand was red
And the judge is telling me : be hanging till I'm dead
The crowd around the courthouse : and the time is growing fast
Soon a good-for-nothing killer : is going to breathe his last
Lord I'm almost dying : gasping for my breath
And that trifling woman staying : until I breaks my neck

Don't the world seem lonely : when you got to battle it all by yourself
Even the one you love : turn their back on you for someone else
My mother and dad left me : when I was too small to help myself
And my sisters and brothers : drove me away to somebody else
I'm motherless and I'm fatherless : I'm almost friendless too
Seems the world is down on you : know knows what to do
Rocks was my pillow : and the cold ground was my bed
The blue skies was my blanket : and the moonlight was my spread

Good morning blues : where have you been so long
I just stopped by to leave you enough of worries : to last you while I'm gone
My brains is cloudy : my soul is upside down
When I get that lowdown feeling : I know the blues must be somewhere close around
The blues is like the devil : it comes on you like a spell
Blues will leave your heart full of trouble : and your poor mind full of hell
Some people say that's no blues : but that story's old and stale
The blues will drive you to drink and murder : and spend the rest of your life in jail
The blues and the devil : is your closest friend
The blues will leave you with murder in your mind : that's when the devil out of hell steps in

And you take all my money and drink it up : and come home and wants to fuss and clown
It hurts to love a person : that don't belong to you
Because when they find out that you really love them : and they don't care what they do
They'll take your heart and they'll use it : like a football on a football ground

Tell me who do you really want : or do you still want your used-to-be

That's why I cover my troubles : so the public don't know what's on my mind

I woke up this morning : and all my shrimps was dead and gone
I was thinking about you baby : will you hear me weep and moan
I got dead shrimps here : someone is fishing in my pond
I've sold you my best bait baby : and I can't do that no more
Everything I do baby : you got your mouth stuck out
Hole where I used to fish : you got me forced out
I got dead shrimps here : someone's fishing in my pond
Catching my goggle-eyed perches : and they barbecuing the bones
Now you taken my shrimp baby : you know you turned me down
I couldn't do nothing : until I got myself unwound

Early one morning : I set down in my door
Lord I sitting here wondering : where in the world can a good man go
I hear my rider hollering : way up on the hill
Said I know it's my rider : she got a voice like a whippoorwill
I'm going to get you a ticket : going to take you on away from here
Lord if you never come back : Lord I will never care
I'm going to write my name : up on my baby's back door
So she can see my name : if she never see me no more

I'm a backbiting mama : looking for a cheating man
When you start double-crossing : you play right into my hand
If you stay out all night : and come home at four
You'll get back in time : to see me unlock my door
You can tell the world : I ain't no fool
I learned backbiting : when I went to school

I wonder : if my sweet baby will wait for me
Maybe someone else :

I've got another woman : man she's so bony and lean
Well she's got something : Lord I ain't never seen
She's got a little bitty foot now : Lord and got them great big thighs
Well she's got something on the under : weep just like a *pool hall eye*

I went to the Gypsy : get my fortune told
Lord the Gypsy told me : boy you got a jellyroll
Ain't nobody in town : cook a jellyroll like mine

I was first on Main Street : Lord and I started down Beale
Looking for my girl : Lord that we all call Lucille
I know you don't want me : why don't you tell me so
Then you won't be bothered : with me around your house no more
Lord my good girl quit me : my kid done put me down
I wouldn't hurt so bad : but the doggone news across town
We got a new way of spelling : Memphis Tennessee
Double M double E : Lord A Y Lord Z
Ooh : my gal done quit me now
I'm going to the river : I'm going to jump overboard and drown

I wish I had : my poor heart in my hand
I'd show you women : how to treat a man
I'm going I'm going : your crying won't make me stay
For the more you cry : further you drive me away
You know you didn't want me : you oughtn't've made no stall
There's plenty more women :
If the river was whiskey : I'd stay drunk all the time
So a woman like you : could not worry my mind
Some of these mornings : baby listen to what I say
I'm going away to leave you : it will be too late to pray

Ooh : what am I going to do now
Because the girl I love : she don't treat me right
Baby : what do you want [me, your papa] to do
Beg borrow and steal : bring it all home to you
Say the sun's going to shine : in my back door some day
Lord the wind's going to blow : blow my blues away
Hey : wonder where the I C train
Babe I'll go to my woman : you go to your man
Ooh : I'd rather be dead and in my grave
Than be here in the world : baby and be your slave

Don't you wish : your good girl was long and tall like mine
Lord she ain't good-looking : but I think she takes her time
Said my good girl said : she didn't want me no more
But she don't mind *dancing* : Lord everywhere I go
Lord the train I ride : is sixteen coaches long
And she don't *allow* nothing : but chocolate to the bone
I'm worried now : been worried all day long
Babe I'm going to be worried : until the day I'm gone
Lord there's some say yellow : but give me my black and brown
When your high brown quit you : your black will run you down
I want to see want to see : the girl I'm *for painted about*
I be so glad : I sure can't help but shout

I'm going away baby : take me seven long months to ride
January February : March April May June July
I was three years old : when my poor mother died
If you mistreat me : mistreat a motherless child
I dreamt last night : the whole round world was mine
Wasn't nothing at all : but my good girl jumping down
She put carbolic in my coffee : turpentine in my tea
Strychnine in my biscuits : Lord but she didn't hurt me
Baby when I marry : going to marry an Indian squaw
Big chief Lord : be my daddy-in-law

I got the blues so bad : it hurts my feet to walk
I wouldn't hurt so bad : but it hurt my tongue to talk
Mama I feel like jumping : through the keyhole in your door
I can jump so easy : your man will never know
Some people say : worried blues ain't tough
If they don't kill you : hell you mighty rough
Hitch up my buggy : please saddle up my black mare
I'm going to find my woman : on the road somewhere
She caught the rumbling : I caught the falling down
If I ever see her : I never turn around
