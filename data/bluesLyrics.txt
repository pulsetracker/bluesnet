	 to drive my blues away

blues and trouble 
	 both running hand in hand

	 when your woman's got another man 
 she will take your bad treatments

 but she's taught me a lesson 
	 about no-good women and men

walking walking 
	 talking to myself 
 wondering if i die 
	 would my baby love somebody else

sighing and crying 
	 broke down with the blues 
 my clothes are worn out 
	 holes all in my shoes

walking across the country 
	 trying to get a stake 
 because my baby 
	 want every cent i make

tired and hungry 
	 i've been walking many days 
 wondering 
	 if my baby would stop her hateful ways

walking across the country 
	 with my head bowed down 
 a woman can still make a man 
	 act like a clown




mr police captain 
	 listen to my plea 
 i want to make my baby 
	 come back home to me

 all i want is a search warrant 
	 and a bottle of gin

 if she thinks she can quit me 
	 she really have lost her mind

	 down to tennessee 
 hard to tell 
	 about a man like me

i met a gal 
	 i couldn't get her off my mind 
 she passed me up 
	 says she didn't like my kind

i'm scared to bother 
	 around her house at night 
 got a police dog 
	 craving for a fight

his name is rambler 
	 and when he gets a chance 
 he leaves his mark 
	 on everybody's pants

guess i'll travel 
	 i guess i'll let her be 
 before she sics 
	 her police dog on me




packing my duffle 
	 going to leave this town 
 and i'm going to hustle 
	 to catch that train southbound

	 for the plow and the hoe 
 walked out of my shoes 
	 over this ice and snow

tune up the fiddle 
	 dust the cat and bow 
 put on the griddle 
	 and open the cabin door

i thought i was going 
	 to the northland to stay 
 south is on my mind 
	 my blues won't go away

potatoes in the ashes 
	 possum on the stove 
 you can have the hash 
	 but please leave me the claw

chicken on the roof 
	 and melons on the vine 
 i'll be glad 
	 to get back to that georgia gal of mine




numbers numbers 
	 about to drive me wild 
 thinking about the money 
	 that i should have had

i dreamed last night 
	 the woman i love was dead 
 if i had played the dead row 
	 i would come out ahead

i act like a fool 
	 and played on three six nine 
 lost my money 
	 and that gal of mine

	 and a brown named mame 
 but the best i've ever had 
	 was the old crow jane

 i'm sitting here wondering 
	 if a woman's worth it now

	 i won't be able to sing my song




don't trust no woman 
	 who mistreats her man 
 when you think she's in your kitchen cooking 
	 she's got a stranger by the hand

ain't no need of you chasing women 
	 brother if you really haven't got the cash 
 other men get all the chicken 
	 and all you get is hash

i have a lot of woman 
	 but i sure don't want one now 
 she always milks me dry 
	 better than you ever milk a cow

mmm 
	 rope stretching all day long 
 i'm singing now mama 
	 because it won't be long

it wouldn't be so bad 
	 if the rope would just get slack 
 i wouldn't mind at all 
	 but i just got a crick in my back

when it's all over mama 
	 and you're all alone by my side 
 just keep the flies from buzzing by me 
	 and then i will be satisfied

	 and tell me one more time 
 when i left 
	 i didn't have my right mind

	 ought to get on out of town

 what good is a woman 
	 if she don't rob and steal

	 on a dollar bill

i haven't any money

	 and i got a good cussing

i saw your mama 
	 your papa too

	 to get these blues off my mind 
 i believe i'll get drunk 
	 and stay drunk all the time

well i'm going to leave you 
	 i ain't going to sing no more 
 because i'm full of blue 
	 and i have got to go




in the wee midnight hours 
	 long before the break of day 
 when the blues creep up on you 
	 and carry your mind away

while i lay in my bed 
	 and cannot go to sleep 
 while my heart's in trouble 
	 and my mind is thinking deep

my mind was running 
	 back to days of long ago 
 and the one i love 
	 i don't see her anymore

blues why do you worry me 
	 why do you stay so long 
 you come to me yesterday 
	 been with me all night long

i've been so worried 
	 i didn't know what to do 
 so i guess that's why

	 sleeping all by yourself 
 when the one that you love 
	 is loving someone else

	 and it may bring drops of rain

	 i don't want you to make me wait

so long people and sweethearts 
	 i'll soon be on my way 
 now i'm leaving this lonesome old town 
	 now i may come back some day

	 until the fireman rang his bell 
 two keen long whistles 
	 bid me long farewell




now i love my good corn liquor 
	 and i really mean i do 
 now i don't care who knows it 
	 and i really mean that too

now i've been drinking my good corn liquor 
	 i mean don't no one get rough

	 but i mean don't start no stuff

	 [and, then] maybe i'll go home

	 but give me my corn i believe all the time 
 reason why i love it so well 
	 it's so soothing to my mind

so give me some more corn liquor 
	 if i get drunk [just please, please just] take me home

	 swear and it won't be long 
 i'm going to catch the first thing smoking 
	 and down the road i'm going

where i long ain't here baby 
	 it's way out in the west 
 in the smoky mountains 
	 where the eagle builds his nest

did you ever love a girl 
	 a girl you hate to lose 
 don't lose your temper 
	 when you've been drinking booze




i had the blues before sunrise 
	 with tears standing in my eyes 
 it's such a miserable feeling 
	 a feeling i do despise

	 everybody's down on me 
 i'm going to cast my troubles 
	 down in the deep blue sea

	 such a long old lonesome day 
 i've been sitting here thinking 
	 with my mind a million miles away

	 and it stops at my front door 
 i'm going to change my way of living 
	 ain't going to worry no more

now i love my baby 
	 but my baby won't behave 
 i'm going to buy me a hard-shooting pistol 
	 and put her in her grave

	 around the corner by myself 
 and if i can't find my baby 
	 i don't want nobody else

 now they laugh and grin at me 
	 because i ain't got a lousy dime

so i'm a hard-hearted papa 
	 i've done changed my ways 
 and i think they will stay changed 
	 for the rest of my days




you left me crying baby 
	 please come back to me 
 and you know i've done all baby 
	 i've been as good as i could be

why did you go 
	 and leave me cold in hand 
 i know what it's all about 
	 it was on account of your other man

now i can't sleep at night 
	 there's rocks all in my bed 
 because i ain't got you pretty mama 
	 to hold my aching head

i'm going to buy me a shiny pistol 
	 i'm coming after you 
 i ain't going to let you 
	 treat me just like you do

so watch your step mama 
	 you know what you've done 
 if you don't come back to me 
	 hot spring water won't help you none




minutes seem like hours 
	 and hours seem like years 
 since i've had these blues 
	 i just can't keep from shedding tears

i'm going to tell everybody 
	 what my good gal done to me one day 
 she put me out and broke my heart 
	 just to pass the time away

now i ain't got no money 
	 and i ain't got nowhere to stay 
 but that's all right baby 
	 if you want to turn me away

you know i work hard baby 
	 and i brung you home my check 
 now i ain't never loved no woman 
	 like i loved you yet




you evil-hearted woman 
	 you got a heart like a stone 
 you don't mean me no good 
	 so i leave you alone

you used to be sweet 
	 but you ain't sweet no more 
 you want to leave me alone 
	 and stay away from my door

you're just like a rattler 
	 you always ready to bite 
 so i'm going to get me a good woman 
	 who will treat me right

yes you're evil 
	 just as evil as you can be 
 i don't want you to cook for me no more 
	 because you might poison me

so be on your way evil-hearted woman 
	 and stay away from my door 
 i done took your foolishness long enough 
	 and i don't want you no more




women if you got a good man 
	 give him three good meals every day 
 if you don't 
	 some other woman is going to tow your man away

i've got so many women 
	 that i don't care when one dies 
 i don't even weep 
	 i don't even cry

some men crave high yellow 
	 but give me black or brown 
 because i can't tell the difference 
	 when the sun goes down

blacker the berry 
	 sweeter is the juice 
 i got a good black woman 
	 and i ain't going to turn her loose

they say black is evil 
	 and they don't mean you no good 
 but i would not quit my black woman 
	 baby if i could

i've got a good black gal 
	 i've got a good black gal 
 she's my buddy 
	 and i swear she is my pal




whiskey is my habit 
	 good women is all i crave 
 and i don't believe in two things 
	 will carry me to my grave

i'm going to louisiana 
	 where i can drink and have my fun 
 i can't stay here much longer 
	 because my time has just about come

when you see me leaving baby 
	 don't you wear no black 
 you see your loving daddy 
	 walking down some lonesome railroad track

when i was a hustler 
	 i'm in my prime 
 i would drink good whiskey 
	 and gamble all the time




she ain't good-looking 
	 but the good gal do go clean 
 and i'm crazy about my baby 
	 though she is so mean

my gal got arrested 
	 and they put her in the county jail 
 they fined her eleven twenty-nine 
	 and they even allowed her no bail

now i'm going to see that judge 
	 and talk to him myself 
 tell him that he sent my gal to the county road 
	 and left me by myself

now i never felt so sorry 
	 till the people walked down the lane 
 and my heart struck sorrow 
	 when they called my good gal's name

and i heard the jailor say hello 
	 prisoners all fall in line 
 i'm also talking about that long-chain woman 
	 that got eleven twenty-nine

i've got the blues so bad 
	 that i just can't rest 
 i'm going to ask that jailor 
	 can i do my good gal's time myself




now you got me grieving mama 
	 over nobody else but you 
 yes you got me grieving mama 
	 i really mean that's true

i'm not going to worry 
	 in my life no more 
 if you want to leave me 
	 you can go

now you got me grieving mama 
	 over nobody else but you 
 yes you got me grieving mama 
	 i love no one else but you

i woke up this morning 
	 didn't find you there 
 wondering what man 
	 had his hand running down through your hair down there

but i'm not going to cry 
	 i'm not going to sigh 
 you going to leave me 
	 bye bye bye




she's got a bed in her bedroom 
	 it shines like a morning star 
 when it starts to rocking 
	 it looks just like a cadillac car

baby baby baby 
	 you had better get your back yard cleaned 
 because you better cook the best old corn bread 
	 a poor man ever seen

	 and your t-bone steak 
 and if you fix it like i like it 
	 i will get you a new v-eight

	 i've got to have it late at night 
 i don't want you to fix it 
	 if you don't fix it right

 because in your kitchen baby 
	 it's where the good stuff can be found

	 it's trying to get her back home

i'm going to pay the boss 
	 and get my check-card today 
 and give it to my sugar 
	 if she'll come back home to stay

	 ain't no way to get along 
 this done caused me a world of trouble 
	 and broke up my happy home

i can't work in the daytime 
	 i can't sleep a wink at night 
 thinking the woman that i love 
	 ain't been treated right




i'm going to get me a brand new [shiny] pistol 
	 with a long shiny barrel 
 i'm going to ramble this town over 
	 until i find my girl

i'm going to go to the station 
	 and try to find her there 
 and if the lord has not got her 
	 she's in this world somewhere

she left me with a head full of trouble 
	 and a head full of misery 
 and now she's got me crying 
	 baby please come back home to me

my mother told me 
	 don't you weep don't you moan 
 because son there'll be women here 
	 when you dead and gone

when i get through rambling 
	 and looking this whole world through 
 i won't be dead with trouble 
	 you know i died to lose




now i'm down and out 
	 ain't got no friends around 
 i'm going from door to door 
	 everybody turns me down

 she's always squabbling 
	 she don't give me a ??? smile

now here i am people 
	 out in the ice and snow 
 my clothes all in pawn 
	 ain't got nowhere to go

she said she liked my music 
	 but my tune's too short 
 but if she gets long winded player 
	 she's sure to get caught

now babe i can't help it 
	 if i can't play long 
 i'm just a little skinny fellow 
	 and a player is strong




if somebody finds me 
	 when i'm dead and gone 
 say i did self-murder 
	 i died with my boots on

took me a smith and wesson 
	 and blew out my brains 
 i didn't take no poison 
	 i couldn't stand the strain

no i ain't no coward 
	 and i'll tell you why 
 i was just tired of living 
	 but wasn't afraid to die

take me to the graveyard 
	 put me in the ground 
 please write on my tombstone 
	 my woman threw me down

in my farewell letter 
	 someone's sure to find 
 goodbye old cruel world 
	 i'm glad i left you behind

 i believe i'll lay down 
	 take morphine and die




now my mama's dead 
	 and my papa can't be found 
 i ain't got nobody 
	 throw my arms around

yonder comes the devil 
	 going to set this town on fire 
 now when the chance comes up 
	 i'm going to bid this town goodbye

i got ways like the devil 
	 slipping around your gate 
 so i can find me a good gal 
	 or won't have to take no hate

 i sat deep in my saddle 
	 and i don't remember the name

sat deep in my saddle lord 
	 and i ??? name 
 just as sure as the train 
	 leaves the rounded curve




i never felt so worried 
	 till i found the loving lady blues 
 

i can't sleep for dreaming 
	 i can't eat for crying 
 i lay down last night 
	 with that gal all on my mind

i got nineteen bird dogs

she's long and tall 
	 and wears a diamond ring 
 but she can beat anybody 
	 at doing that thing

you go through the barrel 
	 and you ride like a tiger 
 you throws your backbone 
	 clean out of sight




you did cause me to weep 
	 you did cause me to moan 
 you did cause me 
	 to leave my home

i cried last night 
	 and the night before 
 and i swore 
	 not to cry no more

	 and turn your lamp around 
 look out your back door 
	 see me leave this town

	 i'm down and out

	 and put me out

	 and the territor' 
 going to catch me the first train 
	 i've got to go

 to be uneasy 
	 be treated right

	 and a diamond ring 
 now come her partner 
	 beat me shaking that thing

the day you left me 
	 won't wear no black 
 i write you a letter 
	 come sneaking back

	 on the road somewhere 
 get your book 
	 and count come and count the days i'm gone

	 find me there 
 yes if i drink smoky 
	 find me on the road somewhere

you can talk about your brick house 
	 but you ought to see mine 
 it ain't so pretty 
	 but it ??? fine

i got up this morning 
	 looked at the rising sun 
 can't nobody run me 
	 like them bloodhounds done

i got up in my stockings 
	 tipping across the floor 
 scared the bloodhounds 
	 are rapping upon my door

now chickens on my back 
	 and there's the hounds on my track 
 i dropped my head 
	 and i couldn't stop to look back

i could hear those pistol balls 
	 zooming by my head 
 i believe to my soul 
	 they going to kill me dead

i got up this morning 
	 just about the break of day 
 i could hear a bunch of bloodhounds 
	 a-coming down my way

i got up this morning 
	 fell down across my bed 
 i could hear something pushing 
	 all around my head




my woman woke up this morning 
	 dollar in her hand 
 two bits for the monkey 
	 six bits for her man




i hocked everything 
	 from my hat down to my shoes 
 so now sweet mama 
	 got those doggone hockshop blues




now right is right 
	 wrong is wrong 
 ain't no harm 
	 to sing a little song

uncle bud went home 
	 just like they said 
 stuck a match 
	 caught a man in his bed

if i go home 
	 about half past ten 
 put the key in the hole 
	 and can't get in

now lucy came home 
	 with a big excuse 
 she left there tight 
	 but she come back loose

i had a little kitty 
	 i called her mine 
 way in the night 
	 i could hear her cry

we shoot a little dice 
	 bound to have a little fun 
 law walked up 
	 and away we run

i asked the lady for a drink 
	 this is what she said 
 i don't have the white 
	 but i have the red

some folks hates it 
	 call it a sin 
 you see women 
	 give money to men




i went down in the alley 
	 trying to sell my coke today 
 and a woman run out and hollered 
	 scared my mule away

i went with iceman jackson 
	 he sold me ice and coke 
 but he blowed in all his money 
	 buying sweet jellyroll

we stopped on eighteenth and federal 
	 just two blocks west of state 
 and when he got up under that ??? 
	 well he would not wait

she said money don't excite me 
	 and that we all know well 
 but jackson showed her fifty dollars 
	 and she almost fell

she had wind like the greyhound 
	 and she sure could run 
 and jackson got down like a reindeer 
	 and he runned her some




tell me pretty daddy 
	 what's the matter now 
 are you trying to quit me 
	 and you don't know how

i'd rather be dead 
	 buried in the sea 
 than to have the man i love 
	 say he don't want me

lord lord 
	 lordy lordy lord 
 oh the man i love 
	 treats me like a dog

i'd rather see 
	 my coffin come rolling in my door 
 than to hear the man i love 
	 say i don't want you no more




i hear these women raving 
	 about their monkey-man 
 about their trifling husbands 
	 and their no-good friends

these poor women sit around 
	 all day and moan 
 wondering why 
	 their wandering papa don't come home

now when you got a man 
	 don't never be on the square 
 because if you do 
	 he'll have a woman everywhere

i never was known 
	 to treat no one man right 
 i keep them working hard 
	 both day and night

i've got a different system 
	 and a way of my own 
 when my man starts kicking 
	 i let him find another home

i get full of good liquor 
	 walk the streets all night 
 go home and put my man out 
	 if he don't act right

you never get nothing 
	 by being an angel child 
 you better change your ways 
	 and get me awhile

i want to tell you something 
	 i wouldn't tell you a lie 
 wild women are the only kind 
	 that do




early this morning 
	 when everything was still 
 my daddy said he was leaving 
	 though it's against my will

he said i'm leaving mama 
	 and your crying won't make me stay 
 the more you cry 
	 the further i'm going away

a man is like a car 
	 that you have to overhaul 
 keep him three or four weeks 
	 and you can't get along at all

i gave him everything 
	 from a diamond on down 
 the next thing i give him 
	 will be six feet of ground




you can always tell 
	 when your best man don't want you around 
 he will come home at night 
	 turn the bed upside down

my heart's full of sorrow 
	 tears come rolling down 
 because my baby 
	 was kentucky bound

the pale moon shines 
	 down on the mountain still 
 way down in old kentucky 
	 mid those high blue hills

shine on old moon 
	 harvest moon shine on 
 because old moon you'll be shining 
	 when i'm dead and gone

i'm going to tell my mama 
	 when i go back home 
 tell her the folks up here 
	 won't let my kentucky man alone




hello central 
	 give me long-distance please 
 i'm begging with tears in my eyes 
	 and down on my bended knees

hello central 
	 give me mr henry brown 
 what you say you were calling 
	 a storm has blown the wires down

listen long-distance 
	 can you send a telegram 
 do this please 
	 before i fall down left in a jam

you just tell him 
	 he better hurry home 
 because i'm tired 
	 of making all these nights alone




takes a southern woman 
	 to sing this southern song 
 lord i'm worried now 
	 but i won't be worried long

when i was downtown 
	 i wouldn't take no one's advice 
 but i ain't going to let 
	 that same bee sting me twice

because i'm going back 
	 where the weather suits my clothes 
 down where there ain't no snow 
	 and the chilly winds never blow

i don't want no northerner 
	 no northern black or brown 
 southern men will stick by you 
	 when the northern men can't be found

you ever been south 
	 you know just what i mean 
 southern men are all the same 
	 from kentucky to new orleans

i'm going back south 
	 where i can get my hambone boiled 
 these northern men 
	 are about to let my poor hambone spoil




the blues came down my alley 
	 and stopped right at my door 
 they made me feel 
	 like i've never felt before

i'm a good-hearted woman 
	 never done nobody wrong 
 but the better i treat my daddy 
	 the worse we get along

if you don't want me daddy 
	 please tell me what to do 
 i've never loved nobody daddy 
	 like i'm loving you

i've got ten little puppies 
	 twelve little shaggy hound 
 it takes all twenty-two 
	 to run my good man down




daddy oh daddy 
	 won't you answer me please 
 all day i stood by your coffin 
	 trying to give my poor heart ease

i rubbed my hands over your head 
	 and whispered in your ear 
 and i wonder if you know 
	 that your mama's near

you told me that you loved me 
	 and i believed what you said 
 and i wished that i could fall 
	 here across your coffin dead

when i left the undertakers 
	 i couldn't help but cry 
 and it hurts me so bad 
	 to tell the man i love goodbye




early this morning 
	 the blues come walking in my room 
 i said blues please tell me 
	 what are you doing here so soon

he looked at me and smiled 
	 but yet they refused to say 
 i asked him again 
	 and they turned and walked away

the first thing they told you 
	 your man you're going to lose 
 at first i didn't believe it 
	 but i found that it was true

blues oh blues 
	 you know you been here before 
 the last time you were here 
	 you made me cry and walk the floor




the time has come 
	 for us to part 
 i ain't going to cry 
	 it won't break my heart

because i'm through with you 
	 and i hope you don't feel hurt 
 

you are like an old horseshoe 
	 that's had its day 
 you're like an old shoe 
	 i must throw away

you're like an old ship 
	 that sprung a leak 
 you ain't young no more 
	 and your loving is weak

you ain't got no money 
	 you're down and broke 
 you're just an old has-been 
	 like a worn out joke




old pal old pal 
	 you stole my man away 
 but that's all right 
	 i'll get him back some day

you stole my man 
	 between midnight and day 
 and if i catch you old pal 
	 i sure will make you pay

why should you 
	 have a daddy of your own 
 old pal old pal 
	 you better let my man alone

old pal you said 
	 two friends could understand 
 but that's no sign 
	 we should take each other's man




going down to the river 
	 take a rope and a rock 
 tie it around my neck 
	 and jump off the dock

ain't no one 
	 can change my mind 
 i've been mistreated 
	 and i don't mind dying

going to get me some poison 
	 kill myself 
 because the man i love 
	 has put me on the shelf

if he didn't want me 
	 he didn't have to lie 
 the day i see him 
	 that's the day he'll die

baby 
	 you don't know my mind 
 when you see me laughing 
	 i'm laughing just to keep from crying

a crooked man's worse 
	 than crooked dice 
 with dice you lose your money 
	 with your man you lose your life

i'm going to get me a razor 
	 and a gun 
 cut him if he stands still 
	 shoot him if he runs

	 swellest man in town 
 women all screaming about me 
	 but i can't give up my brown

daddy's got the washboard 
	 mama's got the tub 
 sister's got the liquor 
	 and brother's got the jug

my water pipe's all rusted 
	 water's running cold 
 someone's in the basement 
	 trying to find the hole

	 wasted away 
 spending and a-lending 
	 and it left me broke today

run here pretty mama 
	 sit down on your daddy's knee 
 i'll tell you 
	 how these women made a perfect fool of me

i wasted lots of money 
	 went out every night 
 my pals done all forsake me 
	 and the times is getting tight

i'm feeling like an outcast 
	 looking like a tramp 
 can't price a post card 
	 can't even buy a stamp

ah you used to call me papa 
	 you used to call me dunce 
 you used to call me daddy 
	 and you used to love me once

some folks need the ice 
	 some folks need the snow 
 if i could get you back 
	 mama i wouldn't need nothing more




you may be little 
	 you may have a tender snoot 
 but i know what you is mama

	 down the avenue 
 making eyes 
	 and flirting too

	 big and fat

	 for that

	 i can't refuse 
 but i don't want it 
	 if it's ever been used

some is tall 
	 some is cute 
 some is sweet 
	 and some is true

i don't mean 
	 to speak so bold 
 can't use it 
	 if it's forty years old




something pounding 
	 in my breast 
 when i lay down 
	 to take my rest

horrid nightmares 
	 scary dreams 
 then the blues 
	 steps on the scene

oh maybe it's the blues 
	 that keeps me worried all the time 
 if i could lose these weary blues 
	 that's on my mind

happiness that comes around 
	 but never comes to stay 
 if i only had someone 
	 just to drive my tears away

if you get a jealous-hearted woman 
	 be careful what you do 
 because there's always somebody 
	 tell her lies on you

 i wouldn't spend a nickel 
	 not to save your soul

because i'm tired of being mistreated 
	 and the way you do 
 want you to tell everybody 
	 that i'm down on you

you taken my money 
	 you left me cold in hand 
 i'm going to black your eye

	 you stayed away all day 
 you must've found something 
	 to keep you away

 because this way you going every night 
	 will soon start me with a rambling mind

i don't mind you going 
	 please don't stay the whole night long 
 because you made me love you baby 
	 and i miss you when you go

oh it seems so different 
	 you don't care for me no more 
 but some day baby 
	 you're going to reap just what you sow




oh tell me baby 
	 how can it be 
 you will give everybody 
	 but you won't give me

ooh baby 
	 the sun begins to shine 
 bought you a brand new dress 
	 now you won't pay me no mind

you can spend my money 
	 but you got to stay at home with me 
 got to give me lots of loving 
	 and keep my company




ain't going to cut no kindling 
	 ain't going to buy no corn 
 i wouldn't spend a quarter 
	 not to save your soul

because i'm tired of being mistreated 
	 tired of the way you do 
 want you to tell everybody 
	 that i'm down on you

you fooled me once 
	 you fooled me twice 
 you fooled me just enough 
	 for me to take your life

you taken my money 
	 you left me cold in hand 
 i'm going to black your eyes 
	 you can go tell your man

you can go tell the sergeant 
	 you can tell chief o'brien 
 but before i take it back 
	 i'd rather serve some time

now you left me this morning 
	 you stayed away all day 
 you must have found something 
	 to keep you away




i'm going to build me a castle 
	 out of ice and snow 
 so i can freeze these barefooted women 
	 away from around my door

just because you were a cheater 
	 i won't give up the game 
 it don't break my heart to win 
	 when i lose i feel the same

i'm going i'm going 
	 my face you'll never see 
 but you can kiss my picture 
	 and think the world of me

you accuse me of women 
	 brought your men right before my face 
 after all your mistreating 
	 no one can take your place




don't care what you say 
	 don't care what you do 
 you sure can't quit your woman 
	 and if she put that thing on you

she put that thing on you 
	 she puts it on you right 
 you can't eat when you get hungry partner 
	 you can't sleep at night

i asked a married woman 
	 to let me be her kid 
 she said she's afraid she'd put that thing on me 
	 and i couldn't keep it hid

my woman quit me 
	 got her another man 
 and the way she had that thing on me 
	 i couldn't raise my hand

now from my experience 
	 i give you your advice 
 if you got a good woman partner 
	 you'd better treat her right




mr drayman mr drayman 
	 back your truck up to my door 
 take my trunk down to the station 
	 take it never here no more

i'm in bad luck now 
	 going to catch me somebody's train 
 take this whole world through 
	 my luck will be bound to change

bad luck wakes me every morning 
	 trouble follows me all night long 
 if i see this ain't no place for me 
	 i'm going back where i belong

i just received a letter 
	 baby won't you please come home 
 say the days seem so lonesome 
	 and the nights so long




believe i'll take 
	 my old-timey rider back 
 because she got a way of loving 
	 that her daddy likes

[awful] nice to meet strangers 
	 just to come and spend the day 
 but that old-timey rider 
	 can drive your blues away

did you ever wake up in the morning 
	 and find your rider gone 
 i know just how it feels 
	 that's why i composed this song

i went to the doctor 
	 for my misery 
 said it's nothing but the blues 
	 bearing down on me

and i asked the doctor 
	 [was there] anything that he could do 
 says i can't do nothing 
	 till that woman come back to you




i believe i'll try 
	 them bad-luck dice again 
 if i keep on a-trying 
	 i'll be bound to win

every man tries to gamble 
	 must have a losing day 
 so he shouldn't get evil 
	 and throw my dice away

sometimes i believe 
	 my woman's bad luck to me 
 because every time i start to gamble 
	 i can't throw a thing but a three

i lost all i had 
	 everything i had to lose 
 even lost the one i love 
	 but i swear i can't lose with you

nine and five my weakness 
	 ten and four keeps me all in pawn 
 but if i ever get lucky 
	 i swear i'll have my diamonds on




i am sorry 
	 that i can't take you 
 you don't know how to gamble 
	 nothing else for you to do

it's not because i love you 
	 but it's just because i've been with you so long 
 and i know you bound to miss me 
	 baby when i'm gone

blues have mercy 
	 have mercy on poor me 
 oh it might be my fault 
	 please have my sympathy

baby if you never 
	 never never no more 
 if you never no more see me 
	 you'll miss me when i go

mmm baby 
	 believe i will go back home 
 going back to the one i love 
	 and acknowledge that i done wrong




a hard-headed woman 
	 just like a bulldog without a chain 
 she won't never listen to what you say 
	 and that will leave your heart in pain

i've fooled with women 
	 till i lost everything i own 
 it was a married woman 
	 cause me to lose my home

a woman's so deceitful 
	 but she's so loving and kind 
 you can pack up your trunk to move 
	 but you will change your mind

you told me you loved me 
	 told my boy friend too 
 and i would not have been here 
	 if it don't been for you

when a dumb man tries to gamble 
	 he expects to lose 
 when you got a hard-headed woman 
	 you bound to have the blues




bad luck and trouble 
	 and the blues without a dime 
 when a man's got money 
	 the blues don't cross his mind

always try 
	 to keep a dollar in your hand 
 when you ain't got no money 
	 your woman get another man

don't never allow your woman 
	 to talk no baby-talk to you 
 you can tell by that 
	 they got something in their heads to do

i don't want no woman 
	 if she ain't got a railroad man 
 because every day's like sunday 
	 i mean she's always got a dollar in her hand




keep your back door locked 
	 baby keeps your windows pinned 
 if your husband should knock 
	 tell him you're cooking and he can't come in

you ought to buy you a bulldog 
	 to watch us whilst we sleep 
 so he can see your husband 
	 if he makes a 'fore-day creep

wake up baby 
	 please don't be so still 
 unless you fixing a good way 
	 to get your daddy killed

what's that baby 
	 pecking on your windowpane 
 say the stars is shining 
	 i know it can't be rain

the big star's falling 
	 i know it can't be long before day 
 and i think it's time for me 
	 to make my get-away




you can jive me baby 
	 but i don't believe a thing you say 
 you just a confidencing woman 
	 and wants to have your way

you can spend my money baby 
	 you can get my loving too 
 i'll do most anything 
	 just to get along with you

i lay down on my pillow 
	 i rolled from side to side 
 i didn't have no blues 
	 i just was not satisfied

when you see me coming 
	 my head all hanging down 
 it's that my sweet woman done quit me 
	 the news all over town

my suitcase is packed 
	 my trunk's already gone 
 you can tell by that 
	 i won't be here long




since we been apart 
	 ??? seems strange to me 
 we been together all these years 
	 and now we can't agree

somebody must have told you 
	 something to worry your mind 
 but you should stop your way of living 
	 and stay at home sometime

all my past life 
	 i found till today 
 i've been trying to listen 
	 to everything you say

if you call that leaving 
	 make the best out of life you can 
 but you must always remember 
	 your daddy has been your friend

some of these mornings 
	 you going to long for me 
 you going to want me baby 
	 just for company




when i was society 
	 the women would not let me be 
 now i'm wild and reckless 
	 and nobody cares for me

some people like religion 
	 some like to rob and steal 
 but i like to play with my yellow women 
	 and my whiskey right from the still

cigarettes is my pleasure 
	 and whiskey i do crave 
 and some long tall and slender 
	 to follow me to my grave

i want to tell you something 
	 happened to me one day

	 stole my heart away




i got a little woman 
	 but i swear she treats me mean 
 well she can bake good jellyroll 
	 and she's so nice and clean

she don't make no charges 
	 she don't set no price 
 but if you roll it once 
	 you want to roll it twice

now the best doctor in my town 
	 says he never heard tell of such 
 little bitty woman 
	 could roll that jellyroll so much

she roll it for uncle bill 
	 he like to lost his mind 
 he want her to keep rolling it 
	 all the time

	 she rolls it over slow

	 then she mix it in her dough

 but somehow i couldn't please you

says i woke up this morning 
	 feeling so bad 
 thinking about the good times 
	 that i once have had

i'm going to pack my suitcase 
	 and down the road i'll go 
 because the good times i used to have 
	 i can't have no more

 i didn't have no sweet woman 
	 just to hold me in her arms

	 and a great long way from home 
 i ain't got nobody 
	 just to teach me right from wrong

i'm bound down in trouble 
	 and you know just how i feel 
 like a broke down engine 
	 without a driving wheel

 but that ain't his name 
	 his name is plain leroy




listen girls and boys 
	 i've got one stick 
 give me a match 
	 and let me take a whiff quick

i started blowing my gauge 
	 and i was having my fun 
 i spied the police 
	 and i started to run

but the very moment 
	 i looked around 
 my mind fell ill 
	 throwed that gauge on the ground

i used to didn't blow gauge 
	 drink nothing of the kind 
 but my man quit me 
	 and that changed my mind

i know to blow this jive 
	 it's a sin and a shame 
 but it's the only thing 
	 ease my heart about my man




you had plenty of money 
	 in nineteen twenty-two 
 but you let other women 
	 make a fool of you

why don't you do right 
	 like some other men do 
 get out of here 
	 and get me some money too

you sitting down wondering 
	 what it's all about 
 if you ain't got no money 
	 they going to put you out

if you had prepared 
	 twenty years ago 
 you wouldn't have been drifting 
	 from door to door

i fell for your jiving 
	 i took you in 
 now all you got to offer me 
	 is a drink of gin




i tried hard 
	 a long time 
 to get you 
	 to change your mind

you want to know 
	 what it's all about 
 if you love me 
	 you will soon find out

i work 
	 hard for you 
 now tell me daddy 
	 what you going to do

when i see you 
	 walking down the street 
 i get the thrill 
	 from my head to my feet

it's no use 
	 for us to fuss and fight 
 we should love some 
	 every night




you got me 
	 feeling sad 
 the worst feeling 
	 i ever had




i got a man 
	 a real handsome one 
 he ain't no loafer 
	 he's just a little old country boy

i love him 
	 if he is a little old country boy 
 yes i love him 
	 because he fills my heart with joy

some people say he is lazy 
	 but i know that is a lie 
 for three years he been doing my work 
	 and i'm perfectly satisfied

i know he will [learn to] love me 
	 when he gets to be a man 
 because i'm always going to feed him 
	 right from my hand

now people all want to know 
	 why do i follow my man 
 there's no need to explain 
	 because they really wouldn't understand




i'm so sorry you heard 
	 i don't know what to do 
 i'm sorry for the time 
	 i made you blue




baby what's the matter 
	 why don't you be yourself 
 if i didn't love you 
	 i'd get somebody else

but you are so dull and rotten 
	 you think everybody like yourself 
 if i didn't love you 
	 i'd get somebody else

because i love you baby 
	 and i want you for myself 
 if i didn't love you 
	 i would get somebody else

the way you been doing 
	 you know it's wrong 
 how do you expect 
	 for us to get along

now maybe some day baby 
	 you'd know for yourself 
 if i didn't love you 
	 i'd get somebody else




you say i'm a fool 
	 and everyone knows 
 they wondering why 
	 i don't let you go

everybody tells me 
	 what he do 
 but still 
	 i don't believe it's true

you say 
	 he don't treat me right 
 but he say he love me 
	 both day and night

i'm telling you 
	 right from the start 
 i don't intend 
	 for us to part

this is all 
	 i have done my best 
 i love him 
	 and darn the rest




i'm so down-hearted 
	 feeling sad 
 baby you left me 
	 sick in bed

mama and papa told me 
	 when i left my home 
 i would have to face 
	 the world alone

i keep knocking 
	 but they won't let me in 
 because you in there with your new love 
	 drinking your gin

i'm so down-hearted 
	 no place to go 
 out in the rain 
	 hail sleet and snow

i'm so down-hearted 
	 everywhere i go 
 hard luck and trouble 
	 meets me at the door




my man done quit me 
	 he done throwed me down 
 i'm sad 
	 because he didn't call around

did you ever lay down 
	 and dream the whole night long 
 dream about your man 
	 and all your ??? is gone




last night i went out alone 
	 i was lonesome as could be 
 how i longed to find someone 
	 to keep my company

strange man strange man 
	 let me come close to you 
 i'm feeling lonely 
	 won't you tell me what to do

i'm looking for someone to love 
	 who can your good gal be 
 i ain't got nobody 
	 and you sure look good to me




call me a freakish man 
	 what more was there to do 
 just because she said i was strange 
	 that did not make it true

i sent her to the mill 
	 to have her coffee ground 
 because my wheel was broke 
	 and my grinder could not be found

you mix ink with water 
	 bound to turn it black 
 you run around with funny people 
	 you get a streak of it up your back

there was a time when i was alone 
	 my freakish ways to see 
 but they're so common now 
	 you get one every day in the week

had a strange feeling this morning 
	 i swear i've had it all day 
 i'll wake up one of these mornings 
	 that feeling will be here to stay




now i was just sitting here wondering 
	 where i would go get some ease 
 now i'm going back to california 
	 so i can do just as i please

crossing that old desert mama 
	 just like breaking the hindenburg line 
 now if you get ditched off on that freight train 
	 you know that will be the end of the line

oh yes i know i know 
	 oh yes i know 
 now the train's at the station 
	 in my mind i'm made up to go

when i reach old los angeles california 
	 you ought to hear me jump and shout 
 now the people in los angeles 
	 they didn't know what it's all about




i feel bluer this morning 
	 than i ever felt before 
 i'm changing friends and men 
	 and i won't be blue no more

i know you 'buke and dog me 
	 baby with your forty-five 
 and i couldn't do nothing 
	 but wring my hands and cry

know you trying to be mean babe 
	 and use me as a child 
 but it's going to hurt you to your heart 
	 when i leave you for a while




i'm tired of being scolded 
	 when i know i'm doing to best i can 
 to keep from being your dog daddy 
	 i will get me a brand new man

no use of getting on your knees 
	 because i can't use you no more 
 i been your dog long enough 
	 so this morning i'll have to go

you know all this time 
	 thinking you was all mine 
 and i come to find 
	 you was worse all the time

and i didn't say one sentence 
	 till six months after you left 
 i'll give you one more chance 
	 to make a man out of yourself




did you ever wake up with the blues 
	 and didn't have no place to go 
 and you couldn't do nothing 
	 but just walk from door to door

it was late last night mama 
	 and i hear you cry out in bed 
 i went over rolled my baby 
	 and she talked all out of her head

if you don't like my loving 
	 what make you keep on worrying me 
 why don't you get you some other man 
	 oh mama and just let me be

good morning mr blues 
	 mr blues i come to talk with you 
 mr blues ain't doing nothing 
	 and i would like to get a job from you




i know you like my loving 
	 i can tell from the way you wine 
 let you taste my jelly 
	 you just worries me all the time

i told you pretty mama 
	 i have the best jelly in your town 
 bet you got a little taste 
	 you just keep on hanging around

i swim deep pretty mama 
	 just like a catfish loaded down 
 and every time you see me 
	 you wants to fall down on the ground

when me and my baby start to loving 
	 we wants to fight like cats and dogs 
 but before it's over with 
	 we hollering lord oh lordy lord




yeah mean mama 
	 where you stay last night 
 oh your hair all wrinkled 
	 and your clothes ain't fitting you right

	 and i could not keep from crying 
 thinking about my rider 
	 she done put me down

	 in my back door some day 
 i know my woman 
	 going to come my way some day

when i get drunk 
	 well i don't want to drink no more

	 have just lay down and died

and i called the undertaker 
	 and the hearse came driving slow 
 made me feel so sorry 
	 to see my baby go

	 just about the dawn of day 
 it was only the wagon 
	 coming to carry my baby away

when i woke up this morning 
	 folks i just started to scream 
 why when i came to find out 
	 that it was just a lonesome midnight dream

	 what my big fat mama said 
 she so big and fat 
	 got to put ashes all in my bed

	 goes on here

	 everything you do she gets off 
 you can hunt you another home 
	 because she don't want you no more




i'm a poor boy 
	 i'm a long way from home 
 i'm a poor boy 
	 ain't got nowhere to go

ain't got nowhere 
	 to lay my worried head 
 sometime 
	 i'd sooner to be dead

please tell me 
	 what you going to do 
 

i left my brown 
	 standing in the door 
 what you reckon she said 
	 you're not obliged to go

i'm a poor boy 
	 stood on the road and cried 
 i didn't have no blues 
	 just couldn't be satisfied

now give me 
	 long-distance phone 
 i want to hear 
	 from my sweet mama back home

i said to her 
	 ring six four nine 
 i want to hear 
	 from that bobcat gal of mine




going up to town 
	 what you want me to bring you back 
 oh just anything 
	 you think your baby like

honey honey 
	 you sweet as a plum 
 baby you throw your arms around me 
	 let's have some fun

going up to town 
	 with my hat in my hand 
 i'm looking for the woman 
	 ain't got no man

mama mama 
	 just look at sis 
 standing on the corner 
	 trying to do the twist

come here sis 
	 you old stinking sow 
 you trying to be a woman 
	 and you don't know how

ain't but two things 
	 i just like 
 that's salting the dog 
	 and balling the jack

wears them in the summer 
	 and she wears them in the fall 
 some folks 
	 they don't wear them at all

honey honey 
	 i'm going to tell you the truth 
 the day you quit me 
	 that's the day you die




if i mistreat you gal 
	 i sure don't mean no harm 
 i'm a motherless child 
	 and i don't know right from wrong

please tell me pretty mama 
	 honey where you stayed last night 
 you didn't come home 
	 till the sun was shining bright

i have to go so far 
	 to get my hambone boiled 
 these atlanta women 
	 going to let my hambone spoil

i done done more for you 
	 than your daddy ever done 
 i give you my jelly 
	 he ain't give you none

when you see two women 
	 always running hand in hand 
 you can bet your bottom dollar 
	 one's got the other one's man

i'm going to the river 
	 get me a dang old rocking chair 
 if the blues overtake me 
	 going to rock on away from here




oh the way my wife treats me 
	 it sure is a sin 
 stayed out all night long 
	 before day come creeping in

 she couldn't say nothing 
	 but it'll never happen again

i think sweet mama 
	 i'll have to let you go 
 so pack up all your clothes 
	 you can't sleep here no more

it's bad to have a crooked woman 
	 she'll keep you living in sin 
 then all she will say 
	 it'll never happen again

now if i had a-listened 
	 to my mama's rule 
 i wouldn't have been singing 
	 these crooked woman blues

	 dirty engineer

	 make my faro wait behind

	 like to make them yammies bawl




so glad i'm brownskin 
	 chocolate to the bone 
 and i've got what it takes 
	 to make a monkey-man leave his home

	 yellow is so lowdown 
 i walk into these houses 
	 just to see these black men frown

i'm just like miss lilliam 
	 i mean miss lynn you see 
 she said a brownskin man 
	 is just all right with me

yellow man won't quit 
	 black man just won't hey 
 but a pigmeat mama crazy 
	 about brownskin baby ways

 but that brownskin gal

 white folks in the parlor playing cards 
	 and they're serving their cake and tea

my baby loves my baby 
	 like a cow loves to chew her cud 
 but that fool just off and left me 
	 she done moved to the piney wood

i was lying down dreaming 
	 when the blues eased up on me 
 i was feeling so blue 
	 down-hearted as could be

a brownskin gal 
	 makes a bulldog bark with pain 
 and a bow-legged mama 
	 make a snail catch a passenger train

now you can always tell 
	 when your woman treats you mean 
 i say your meals are never ready 
	 and your house ain't never clean

she will come downstairs 
	 a towel was tied around her head 
 you'll ask her for loving 
	 she'll swear she's almost dead




i left my baby 
	 standing in the doorway crying 
 she said daddy you've got a home 
	 just as long as i got mine

	 papa told me too 
 some day son 
	 candy's going to be the death of you

now it's chocolate candy 
	 till my dying day 
 the same old candy 
	 is going to carry me away

i've got one good woman 
	 trying to make it four 
 when one pretty woman quits me 
	 i'll have three more




i had the blues last night 
	 i've got them again today 
 my man told me 
	 he was going away

trouble trouble 
	 is all i can see 
 look like my man 
	 has turned his back on me

just let me tell you 
	 what your friends will do 
 grin in your face 
	 and then they'll talk about you

me and my girl friend 
	 went out for a little run 
 when she seen my man 
	 she told him what i had done

bring me a pint of whiskey 
	 and a bottle of beer 
 if i get drunk 
	 i sure don't care

take me back baby 
	 try me one more time 
 i do everything 
	 to satisfy your mind

listen people 
	 to what i'm telling you 
 don't let your left hand 
	 know what your right hand do




i woke up this morning 
	 with the blues all around my bed 
 i felt just like 
	 somebody in my family was dead

i began to moan 
	 and i began to cry 
 my sweet man went away 
	 you know the reason why

if you don't like my sweet potato 
	 what made you dig so deep 
 you in my potato field 
	 three or four times a week

whooping i've been whooping 
	 whooping all night long 
 whooping i've been whooping 
	 ever since my man been gone

my dog got the rabbit 
	 the rabbit fell down on his knees 
 he looked up at the dog 
	 he say won't you have mercy on me please

just as sure 
	 as you hear me sing this song 
 you never miss your jelly 
	 till your jellyroller's gone




play that thing 
	 play that thing just right 
 we got to scuffle 
	 that house rent tonight

my house rent's due 
	 my gas going up to ten 
 i wouldn't have no lights 
	 but the lightman couldn't get in




i want all you people 
	 to listen to my song 
 remember me 
	 after the days i'm gone




the storm is rising 
	 the rains begin to fall 
 i'm all alone by myself 
	 no one to love me at all

my blues at midnight 
	 and don't leave me until day 
 i've got no sweet woman 
	 to drive my blues away

blues 
	 falling like showers of rain 
 every once in a while 
	 think i hear my baby call my name




i'm lonesome as i can be 
	 baby please come home to me 
 because you know i love you 
	 and how come we can't agree

you been gone the whole night long 
	 i believe to my soul something going on wrong 
 but there will come a day 
	 and i know you will be glad to say

i tried to please your mind 
	 and you keep me worried all the time 
 you will either run me crazy 
	 or i'll lose my mind

you know you don't treat me right 
	 when you stay out both day and night 
 and i must stop you now 
	 because you got to consider somehow

you know i love you now 
	 and i love you all along 
 although you my sweet woman 
	 and i mean you can't go wrong




i was sitting in my kitchen 
	 looking way out across the sky 
 i thought the world was ending 
	 i started to cry

the wind was howling 
	 the buildings begin to fall 
 i seen that mean old twister coming 
	 just like a cannonball

the world was black as midnight 
	 i never heard such a noise before 
 sound like a million lions 
	 when they turn loose their roar

poor people was screaming 
	 and running every which a-way 
 i fell down on my knees 
	 i started in to pray

the shack where we was living 
	 she reel and rock but never fell 
 how the cyclone spared us 
	 nobody but the lord can tell




it's raining and storming on the sea 
	 we're miles and miles from shore 
 the way the waves is rocking this ship 
	 we won't see home no more

the wind is so strong 
	 turning this old ship round and round 
 something tells me 
	 won't be long before we're sinking down

the captain say get your lifesavers 
	 fasten them around your waist 
 because we're sinking down 
	 and the lifeboat is your safest place

uncle sam's ship was coming 
	 painted in red white and blue 
 we say we live in new york city 
	 red white and blue brought us all the way through




mmm 
	 i feel myself sinking down 
 my body is freezing 
	 i feel something cold creeping around

my windows is rattling 
	 my doorknob turning round and round 
 this haunted house blues is killing me 
	 i feel myself sinking down

i been fastened in this haunted house 
	 six long months today 
 the blue ghost has got the house surrounded 
	 lord and i can't get away

they got shotguns and pistols 
	 standing all around my door 
 they haunt me all night long 
	 so i can't sleep no more

the blue ghost haunts me all night 
	 the nightmare ride me all night long 
 they worry me so in this haunted house 
	 i wish i was dead and gone




i went down to the levee 
	 and [over, out] to the freight house yard 
 they paid a dollar an hour 
	 but the work was too long and hard

have pigtails in my pantry 
	 neckbones on my shelf 
 i ain't got none to give you 
	 i got just enough for myself

i'm going to buy me a shotgun 
	 long as i am tall 
 i'm going to shoot my woman 
	 just to see her fall

over yonder's the river 
	 yonder is your big lake 
 at your house rent party 
	 you made your last mistake

i chew my bacca 
	 and i spit my juice 
 i tried to love you so hard 
	 but i found out there's no use




although we are drifting 
	 so far apart 
 my arms may be empty 
	 have not give up in my heart

although we are drifting 
	 so far apart 
 my arms may be empty 
	 but never down in my heart




look down look down 
	 that long old lonesome road 
 and look up to the good lord 
	 just before you go

that's a long that's a long 
	 a long old tiresome road 
 you'll find troubles and worries 
	 that you never found before

then look back look back 
	 and see what you're leaving all alone 
 to grieve and worry 
	 after the days you gone

then your days begin dreary 
	 down that long old lonesome road 
 and you want the lord have mercy 
	 how much more further i've got to go

that's a long old road 
	 a long road that has no end 
 then the blues will make you think 
	 about all your right-hand friends




something keep a-moaning 
	 i don't know what it is 
 

when my right eye winks 
	 on my knees i begin to crawl 
 it will be hell to tell the captain 
	 if i catch another man kicking in my stall

there's no use a-worrying 
	 baby about the days being long 
 the black snake is got the dough 
	 you can't roll him from home




they tell me blues and trouble 
	 walk hand in hand 
 but you ain't had no trouble 
	 till your woman falls for some no-good man

a married woman will swear 
	 she'll love you all her life 
 and meet her other man around the corner 
	 and tell the same lie twice

you tell me you've had troubles 
	 and worry all your life 
 man but you ain't had no trouble 
	 till you fall for another man's wife

then if you get a woman of your own 
	 and make her happy night and day 
 there will be some no-good man she'll fall for 
	 pretty soon she'll go away

when it begin raining

	 she don't dress fine 
 the way that gal can love 
	 change any man's mind

now she bake good jellyroll 
	 she bakes it nice and hot 
 it never fails 
	 to touch the spot

if i was sentenced to be hung 
	 and this ain't no lie 
 if i could just see my baby 
	 i would be willing to die

now my gal is built 
	 long and tall 
 lord when she starts to loving 
	 i can't help from to fall

she likes her music soft 
	 when the lights are low 
 when she starts to kiss me

when i met my gal 
	 she was dumb as dumb could be 
 but i believe to my soul 
	 she put that thing on me




if you got over fifteen grand 
	 better split it ninety-nine different ways 
 because the racketeers 
	 got no certain place to dig your grave

when they demand your money 
	 you got to give it up with a smile 
 and if you refuse 
	 they'll read about you in a short little while

when the gang is out to get you 
	 it don't do no good to run 
 it's true you can dodge the law 
	 but you can't dodge them slugs out the machine gun

you [slave, work] hard for your money 
	 just to give it to some other one 
 and if you refuse 
	 the answer will be from a racketeer's gun

when the gang is out to get you 
	 they'll follow you everywhere 
 you can even move to west hell 
	 doggone if they don't find you there




you've got a hatchet under your pillow baby 
	 you got ice pick in your hand 
 the best thing you better do 
	 is find you another man

you've got a shotgun in the corner 
	 blackjack under your bed 
 but you'll never catch me asleep 
	 i know you wants to whip my head

you put lice all in my gravy 
	 black potash in my tea 
 but i fed it to your man baby 
	 instead of me

that's the very reason why 
	 you been so mean to me 
 trying to steal my life 
	 to have your old used-to-be




people is [raving, hollering] about hard times 
	 tell me what it's all about 
 hard times don't worry me 
	 i was broke when it first started out

friends it could be worser 
	 you don't seem to understand 
 some is crying with a sack of gold under each arm 
	 and a loaf of bread in each hand

if you're a single man 
	 you better drink and have your fun 
 because when that lovebug bites you 
	 then your worries ain't never  done

people raving about hard times 
	 i don't know why they should 
 if some people was like me 
	 they didn't have no money when times was good




it's been snowing forty days and nights 
	 lakes and rivers begin to freeze 
 some places through my old home town 
	 water's up above my knees

storm begin rising 
	 and the sun begin sinking down 
 i says mother and dad pack your trunk 
	 we ain't safe here in this town

when it lightning my mind gets frightened 
	 my nerves begin weaken down 
 and the shack where we was living 
	 begin moving around

women and children were screaming 
	 saying mama where must we go 
 the flood water have broke the levee 
	 and we ain't safe here no more




you see it ain't what you used to be baby 
	 it's what you are today 
 you see your good looks didn't hold your man 
	 a little black gal's loving stole your man away

i've got a woman now that i love 
	 better than i love myself 
 she treats me so cold sometimes 
	 i think she got somebody else




you arms don't feel the same 
	 your lips is icebox cold 
 it's a mean black snake 
	 is making his morning stroll

you know 
	 you once was the sweetest woman i ever found 
 but since you been running out with your girl friend 
	 you just a plain old everyday clown




if love is a crime then i'm guilty 
	 but there's nothing i can do 
 after all the good women in this world 
	 why did i have to fall in love with you




don't the world seem lonely 
	 when you got to battle it all by yourself 
 even the one you love 
	 turn their back on you for someone else

my mother and dad left me 
	 when i was too small to help myself 
 and my sisters and brothers 
	 drove me away to somebody else

i'm motherless and i'm fatherless 
	 i'm almost friendless too 
 seems the world is down on you 
	 know knows what to do

rocks was my pillow 
	 and the cold ground was my bed 
 the blue skies was my blanket 
	 and the moonlight was my spread




good morning blues 
	 where have you been so long 
 i just stopped by to leave you enough of worries 
	 to last you while i'm gone

my brains is cloudy 
	 my soul is upside down 
 when i get that lowdown feeling 
	 i know the blues must be somewhere close around

the blues is like the devil 
	 it comes on you like a spell 
 blues will leave your heart full of trouble 
	 and your poor mind full of hell

some people say that's no blues 
	 but that story's old and stale 
 the blues will drive you to drink and murder 
	 and spend the rest of your life in jail

the blues and the devil 
	 is your closest friend 
 the blues will leave you with murder in your mind 
	 that's when the devil out of hell steps in




i work all day long for you 
	 until the sun go down 
 and you take all my money and drink it up 
	 and come home and wants to fuss and clown

it hurts to love a person 
	 that don't belong to you 
 because when they find out that you really love them 
	 and they don't care what they do

they'll take your heart and they'll use it 
	 like a football on a football ground 
 and when they get through playing with your heart 
	 and they'll start dragging you all around




want all of you people to listen 
	 while my guitar sings 
 if you ain't got that rhythm 
	 it don't mean a thing

some people thinks i'm dead 
	 because i've been gone so long 
 i just stop to see 
	 would you miss me from singing these lonesome songs

i want all you people to listen 
	 while i swing this song 
 if you were born with that rhythm 
	 honest you can't never go wrong




storm is rising 
	 and the rain begin to fall 
 trouble is breaking down my window 
	 blues breaking down my door

my blues started at sunrise 
	 and rides me all through the day 
 it takes the sweet woman i love 
	 to drive these blues away

come into my arms sweet woman 
	 and please explain yourself to me 
 tell me who do you really want 
	 or do you still want your used-to-be

because sometimes you with me 
	 baby then again you gone 
 if you want your used-to-be 
	 then you better let me alone

blues 
	 falling like showers of rain 
 every once in a while 
	 i can hear my baby call my name




i've been drinking all night long 
	 i've started again today 
 i been trying my best 
	 to drink these worried blues away

some people drinks to hide their [worries and] troubles 
	 but that don't mean a thing 
 when you think your troubles are gone 
	 and you find yourself drunk again

friends i drink to keep from worrying 
	 i smile to keep from crying 
 that's why i cover my troubles 
	 so the public don't know what's on my mind

i said i was through with love 
	 both whiskey wine and gin 
 you know when i found myself 
	 i was lap-legged drunk again

love will make a-many man drink and gamble 
	 and stay out all night long 
 love will drive you to many places 
	 sometimes where you don't belong




mmm 
	 something cold is creeping around 
 blue ghost has got me 
	 i feel myself sinking down

black cat and an owl 
	 come to keep me company 
 they understands my troubles 
	 mmm and sympathize with me

i been in this haunted house 
	 for three long years today 
 blue ghost has got my shack surrounded 
	 oh lord and i can't get away

i feel cold arms around me 
	 and ice lips upon my cheek 
 my lover is dead 
	 how plainly plainly i can hear her speak

my windows begin rattling 
	 and my doorknob is turning around and around 
 my lover's ghost has got me 
	 and i know my time won't be long




it's been snowing forty days 
	 and the ground is covered with snow 
 i'm snow-bound in my cabin 
	 and ice up around my door

i woke up this morning 
	 couldn't even get out my door 
 i was snowbound in my cabin 
	 had water seeping up through my floor

snow begin melting 
	 and the rain begin to fall 
 the backwaters done broke the levee 
	 and i can't stay here no more

rowed my boat 
	 just about four miles across the pond 
 backwater done wrecked my cabin 
	 and there's no place that i can call my home




what makes the rooster 
	 crow every morning before day 
 to let the pimps know 
	 that the workingman is on his way

we're up before sunrise 
	 slaving sixteen hours a day 
 we pay our house rent and grocery bills 
	 and the pimps get the rest of our pay

men can't you see 
	 you can't keep a whole woman by yourself 
 if your best friend can't get your woman 
	 he'll frame her for somebody else

something about some women 
	 that i never could understand 
 they're not satisfied with a good husband 
	 they want some other woman's man

six pallbearers 
	 take his to his last go-round 
 going to place him 
	 'neath six feet of ground

went gay-cutting 
	 with another sealskin brown 
 rambled 
	 till the butcher cut him down




going north child

 so i won't be alone 
	 can hear my northbound blues

 just keep him well supplied 
	 with down-home jellyroll

if he's got a little something 
	 not like the rest 
 just keep him busy

he beats you then and loves you 
	 pay that no mind 
 because what you got must suit him

 i been all out in the country 
	 with my big bell on




baby i can see 
	 just what's on your mind 
 you got a long black woman 
	 with a gold teeth in her face

i'll take a long look 
	 right smack down in your mind 
 and i don't see but one woman 
	 rambling up and down the line

don't kid your mama 
	 you ain't fooling nobody but yourself 
 and when i see on your mind 
	 you would not have no friend

i remember the day 
	 when i was living at lula town 
 my man did so many wrong things 
	 that i had to leave the town

i'm by the riverside 
	 my man caught the transfer boat 
 and the last time i seed him 
	 he had done gone way up the road

well i'm worried now 
	 and i won't be worried long 
 




now if you want to learn this dance 
	 don't do it in a pout 
 put both feet together 
	 and do the macon cutout

you need not to worry 
	 neither think 
 just tell the waiter man 
	 to bring on a drink

now you grab your girl 
	 you hold her tight 
 you do it in one position 
	 all night

ease up daddy 
	 you been a good old scout 
 you made a hit with your mama 
	 now you can't lose out

now back in eighteen hundred 
	 and sixty-two 
 folks mess around 
	 but they didn't know what to do

old uncle mose 
	 he was the jellyroll king 
 he get to flat-foot shuffling 
	 call it everything

old rufus pete 
	 he was very slow 
 all the women loved him 
	 and give him their dough

now take it easy mama 
	 and be a good scout 
 if you want to do this dance 
	 macon cutout




now i went downtown 
	 along broadway 
 looked up at a sign 
	 that said no free meals today

walked right in 
	 i took a seat 
 waiter looked at me and said 
	 hey brother pay up before you eat

i was raggedy 
	 thirsty too 
 last all my money 
	 was won from two-by-two

in my pocket 
	 i didn't have a cent 
 sashay down the street 
	 to where i went

in your pockets 
	 you ain't ain't got a dime 
 look all over town 
	 not a friend you can find

as soon as your money 
	 grows treetop tall 
 bill jack and harry 
	 will give you a call

now listen now brother 
	 this ain't no doubt 
 nobody wants you 
	 when you're down and out

now i was singing 
	 them lonesome kind of blues 
 i thought i'd play some numbers 
	 like most colored people do

i put my money down 
	 on old twenty-two 
 i didn't play no believing 
	 i thought that would do

as soon as i saw 
	 that i had won 
 the man brought over eleven 
	 instead of twenty-one

a friend walked up to me 
	 the very next day 
 he said he lost on that number 
	 the very same way




i got spreading mustard 
	 from north to south 
 seeds taste good 
	 right in your mouth




i went to the gypsy 
	 get my fortune told 
 lord the gypsy told me 
	 boy you got a jellyroll

ain't nobody in town 
	 cook a jellyroll like mine 
 

i was first on main street 
	 lord and i started down beale 
 looking for my girl 
	 lord that we all call lucille

i know you don't want me 
	 why don't you tell me so 
 then you won't be bothered 
	 with me around your house no more

lord my good girl quit me 
	 my kid done put me down 
 i wouldn't hurt so bad 
	 but the doggone news across town

we got a new way of spelling 
	 memphis tennessee 
 double m double e 
	 lord a y lord z

ooh 
	 my gal done quit me now 
 i'm going to the river 
	 i'm going to jump overboard and drown




i wish i had 
	 my poor heart in my hand 
 i'd show you women 
	 how to treat a man

i'm going i'm going 
	 your crying won't make me stay 
 for the more you cry 
	 further you drive me away

you know you didn't want me 
	 you oughtn't've made no stall 
 there's plenty more women 
	

if the river was whiskey 
	 i'd stay drunk all the time 
 so a woman like you 
	 could not worry my mind

some of these mornings 
	 baby listen to what i say 
 i'm going away to leave you 
	 it will be too late to pray




ooh 
	 what am i going to do now 
 because the girl i love 
	 she don't treat me right

baby 
	 what do you want [me, your papa] to do 
 beg borrow and steal 
	 bring it all home to you

say the sun's going to shine 
	 in my back door some day 
 lord the wind's going to blow 
	 blow my blues away

hey 
	 wonder where the i c train 
 babe i'll go to my woman 
	 you go to your man

ooh 
	 i'd rather be dead and in my grave 
 than be here in the world 
	 baby and be your slave




don't you wish 
	 your good girl was long and tall like mine 
 lord she ain't good-looking 
	 but i think she takes her time

said my good girl said 
	 she didn't want me no more 
 but she don't mind dancing 
	 lord everywhere i go

lord the train i ride 
	 is sixteen coaches long 
 and she don't allow nothing 
	 but chocolate to the bone

i'm worried now 
	 been worried all day long 
 babe i'm going to be worried 
	 until the day i'm gone

lord there's some say yellow 
	 but give me my black and brown 
 when your high brown quit you 
	 your black will run you down

i want to see want to see 
	 the girl i'm for painted about 
 i be so glad 
	 i sure can't help but shout




i'm going away baby 
	 take me seven long months to ride 
 january february 
	 march april may june july

i was three years old 
	 when my poor mother died 
 if you mistreat me 
	 mistreat a motherless child

i dreamt last night 
	 the whole round world was mine 
 wasn't nothing at all 
	 but my good girl jumping down

she put carbolic in my coffee 
	 turpentine in my tea 
 strychnine in my biscuits 
	 lord but she didn't hurt me

baby when i marry 
	 going to marry an indian squaw 
 big chief lord 
	 be my daddy-in-law




i got the blues so bad 
	 it hurts my feet to walk 
 i wouldn't hurt so bad 
	 but it hurt my tongue to talk

mama i feel like jumping 
	 through the keyhole in your door 
 i can jump so easy 
	 your man will never know

some people say 
	 worried blues ain't tough 
 if they don't kill you 
	 hell you mighty rough

hitch up my buggy 
	 please saddle up my black mare 
 i'm going to find my woman 
	 on the road somewhere

she caught the rumbling 
	 i caught the falling down 
 if i ever see her 
	 i never turn around
