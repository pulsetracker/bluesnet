I said look a-here mama : what in the world are you trying to 
do
You want to make me love you : you going to break my heart in two
I said you don't want me : what made you want to lie
Now the day you quit me fair brown : baby that's the day you die
I'd rather see you dead : buried in some cypress grove
Than to hear some gossip mama : that she had done you so
It was early one morning : just about the break of day
And along brownskin coming : man and drove me away
Lord my baby quit me : she done set my trunk outdoors
That put the poor boy wandering : Lord along the road
I said trouble here mama : and trouble everywhere you go
And it's trouble here mama : baby good gal I don't know

I got something I'm going to tell you : mama keep it all to yourself
Don't you tell your mama : don't you tell nobody else
I'm going to write you a letter : I'm going to mail it in the air
Then I know you going to catch it : babe in this world somewhere
I'm going to write you a letter : I'm going to mail it in the sky
Mama I know you going to catch it : when the wind blows on the line
Ooh : mama I don't know what to do
I knows you'll go : leave me all lowdown and blue
Ooh : that's the last word you said
And I just can't remember : babe last old words you said

And I rolled and I tumbled : and I cried the whole night long
And I rose this morning : and I didn't know right from wrong
Have you ever woke up : and found your dough-roller gone
Then you wring your hands : and you cry the whole day long
And I told my woman : just before I left your town
Don't you let nobody : tear the barrelhouse down
And I fold my arms : and I begin to walk away
I said that's all right sweet mama : your trouble's going to come some day

Lord I know my baby : sure going to jump and shout
When the train get here : I come a-rolling out
Lord I tell you it wasn't no need : of mama trying to be so kind
Ah you know you don't love me : you ain't got me on your mind
Mmm : you ain't got me on your mind
And it's what is the need : of baby trying to be so kind
Mmm : tried to treat her right
But you started with another man : and stayed out every day and night
Says I ain't going down : this big road by myself
If I can't get you mama : I'm going to get somebody else
Mmm : what you want your babe to do
Says I know it's something : gal it ain't no use

Yes today has been : a long old lonesome day
Lord it seem like tomorrow : going to be the same old way
Oh tell me pretty mama : how you want your rolling done
Don't want to do : just like my old-time rider done
Don't a woman act funny : she's going to put you down
She *jumped in the bay* : with a case of
Woman *use the jelly* : I like those old-time

I've got a brownskin woman : she lives up on that hill
Lord the fool trying to quit me : man but I love her still
She was a *broad back middy* : and a gambling stomping whore
She got a new way of getting down : have to get low as a toad
Some of [these, you] women : I just can't understand
They cook corn bread for their husbands : and biscuits for their men

I been working on the section : *section* thirty-two
I'll get a dollar and a quarter : I won't have to work hard as you
Oh nigger licked molasses : and the white man licked them too
I wonder what in the world : is the Mexican going to do
Oh captain captain : what's the matter with you
If you got any Battle Ax : please sir give me a chew
Water boy water boy : bring your water around
If you ain't got no water : set your bucket down
Oh captain captain : what time of day
Oh he looked at me : and he walked away

Lord they accused me of murder : I haven't harmed a man
Oh they accused me of forgery : I can't write my name
Oh I went all around : that whole corral
Lord I couldn't find a mule : with his shoulder well
Oh I worked old Maude : and I worked old Belle
Lord I couldn't find a mule : Maggie with his shoulder well
Mmm : mmm
Mmm : Lord that morning bell
Lord she went up the country : and but she's on my mind

Oh if she don't come on the big boat : she better not land

Some of these women : I just can't understand
They run around here : with one another's man
Oh black woman evil : brownskin evil too
Going to get me a yellow woman : see what she will do
Going to get me a heaven : heaven kingdom of my own
So these brownskin women : can cluster around my throne

Lord she won't pick cotton : girl won't pick no corn
Baby I don't see why : you want to hang around me so long
And it's one two three four : five six seven eight nine
When I count them blues : the men and women is mine
Lord if I get lucky : mama in this world again
I ain't going to fool with no more women : and a mighty few men
Mmm : mmm
Lord I walked all last night : and all last night before

I was sitting on a log : just like a doggone dog
That's the mean old woman : come and crossed my heart
Says I went to the church : and they called on me to pray
I fell down on my knees : and forgot just what to say
Oh Lordy mama : what am I to do
I'm going to stay right here : wait on something new

Mama I ain't going to be : your old work ox no more
You done fooled around woman : let your ox get gored
She will get up early in the morning : just awhile before day
Then cook your breakfast : man rush you away
Come in daddy : know my ox is gone
You can never tell : when your ox is coming back home
You can never tell : what the double-crossing women will do
Says they will have your buddy : then play fake on you

My woman got something : just like the rising sun
You can never tell : when that work is done
It's no use to worrying : about the days being long
Neither worry about your rolling : because it's sure going on
She got something round : and it look just like a bat
Sometime I wonder : what in the hell is that

Listen here woman : I'm calling on your name
You got me in trouble : and you say you ain't to blame
Don't you never drive : a stranger from your door
He may be your best friend : mama says you don't know
My woman got something : and I ain't ashamed
When I love my woman : it puts me in a strain

Some men like dogging : I just declare I don't
Babe if you think I'm same your mistreating men : I declare I won't
Let's stop our foolishness : and try to settle down
Says I [always] [wants, likes] a woman : that do not run around
I used to have a woman : good as any in this town
She had so many men : she kept me always crying

I'm going to get up in the morning : do like Buddy Brown
I'm going to eat my breakfast : man and lay back down
When a man get hairy : know he needs a shave
When a woman get musty : you know she needs to bathe
I've got something to tell you : make the hair rise on your head
Got a new way of loving a woman : make the springs screech on her bed
If you don't believe I love you : look what a fool I've been
Woman if you don't believe I love you : ah look what a shape I'm in
I says I love my baby : better than I do myself
If she don't love me : she won't love nobody else

Now my home's on the water : spending awhile on land
I was trying to find a woman : that ain't got no man
Says I used to have a friend : by the name of Sam
Says we was ragged and dirty : some called us a tramp
Says I stole my woman : from my friend they call him Sam
Says that scoundrel got lucky : stoled her back again
I was raised on the desert : born in a lion's den
Says my chief occupation : taking *musky* men women
Says I never had a woman : couldn't get her back again
Says I traveled over this country : every kind of man

I been moaning moaning : ever since you been gone
Going to find a new way of moaning : bring my woman back home
Says I went back home : and I looked up side the wall
Says I could not find : my woman's clothes at all

Mmm : mmm
I been moaning woman : ever since you been gone
Says I went back home : and I looked up on the shelf
Says I'm getting mighty tired : sleeping by myself
Says I went back home : and I walked up and down the hall
Says I spied another mule : pawing in my stall
Says I moaned early in the morning : moaned late late at night
I was trying to moan to your satisfaction : till I treat my woman right
Mmm : mmm
Says I'm going to moan going to moan : till I treat my baby right

A married woman : best woman ever been born
Only trouble you have : is trying to keep her at home
My woman left me this morning : but I blame myself
That backbiting man taken my woman : now he's going to the west
I can't sleep at night : when I lay down to take my rest
Say the woman I love Lord : she is my partner's maid

I seen better days : when times wasn't so hard
Says my woman got mad : and drove me out of her yard
I wonder what can the matter : with poor Betsy Mae
Lord she got mad : and drove poor me away
Says I wonder what's the matter : with my troublesome mind
Says I must be thinking : about my woman I left behind
My woman she got something : works like sleeping pills
It takes all of my time : to try to keep my backbone still
That's why I can't keep from thinking : times I used to have
Sometime I think : Lord I declare I declare

I was sitting looking : way out across the world
Said the wind had things switching : almost in a twirl
Says I been a good fellow : just good as I can be
Says it's Lord have mercy : Lord have mercy on me
Mmm : mmm
Says I been a good fellow : just as good as a man could be
Some *lost their baby* : was blowing for two three miles around
When they come to their right mind : they come on back to town
Said rooster was crowing cows was lowing : never heard such a noise before
Does it seem like hell was broke out : in this place below

Says I wonder where : my easy rider gone
She's a easy rider : but she do right not so long
Some give her a nickel : some give her a lousy dime
She's a easy rider : but she do right all sometime
I wonder what's the matter : you ain't got no settled mind
Says I got a little woman : ??? behind

I ain't going to tell no story : tell you no doggone lie
Say when you get to loving : man I near about die

Did you ever wake up : between midnight and day
And felt for your rider : she done eased away
Fourteen long years : C and O run by my door
My fair brown told me this morning : she didn't want me no more
If you don't want me baby : what makes you wine and cry
You put that thing on me mama : and let a black child die
Which a-way which a-way : did the C and O leave your town
She's gone west baby : *Capital* Creek Junction bound

Want all of you men : to clearly understand
Take a Alabama woman : sure going to quit you for another man

If you want to come to your baby : you can see me any time
Take me for your prisoner : let that one I love go free
Six months in the workhouse : sure ain't hard for me
If you take me back baby : I'll let you be my boss
Let you do anything : but nail me on the cross
Baby baby baby : I got all my clothes out on pawn

Trouble trouble : ever since I been a man
Seems like me and trouble : is just running hand and hand
I've had trouble in Rock Island : also on the old S T
But I seem so miscontented : every time I ride the big I C
Very next time I ride the I C : that long whistle blow
I'm going to hop right on : won't even stop to pack my clothes
When that I C train : goes hurrying around that lonesome bend

Now look a-here Mr wild water : why do you treat me so doggone  mean
Says you took my house out of Cairo : carried it down in New Orleans

Now when you happy mama : everybody smiles with you
Just as soon as you feel down-hearted: the whole round world turns blue
Now when the sun is shining : everybody's happy as can be
Just as soon as it start to raining : you quiver just like a leaf on a tree
Now I got something to tell you mama : and I really want you to  understand
Every man you see wearing britches : he sure God ain't no monkey-man
Now when I had plenty money : everybody want to be my friend
Just as soon as I got ragged and hungry : now they all wants to laugh and grin
Now I'm going to tell all you people : when I get on my feet again
Says you need not ask for no small favors : just go ahead laugh and grin

Now this dark cloud is rising : and it's thundering all around
Look like something bad is going to happen : you better lower your airplane down
Now that mean old twister's coming : poor people running every which a-way
Everybody's got to wonder : what's the matter with this cruel world today
Now my mama told me : when I was only five months old
If you obey your preacher : the good Lord is going to bless your soul
Now the daylight is failing : and the moon begin to rise
I'm just down here weeping and moaning : right by my mama's side
Now I'm going home : I done did all in this world that I could
Says I got everybody happy : around here in my neighborhood

When I was down in Georgia : I was doing mighty well
Since I been here in Chicago : I been catching a plenty hell
Says I'm going down to the station : ain't going to take no one's advice
Says I'm going back to Georgia : where I can get my red beans and rice
Now these Chicago women : have give me such a hard way to go
Says they done took all my black money : and they got me running from door to door
Now I been setting here looking : way down that lonesome road
Says I'm raggedy and I'm hungry : and I ain't got no place to go
Now I been rolling : I been rolling from sun to sun
Says I got where I can't get no loving : not until my payday comes

Said I ain't no preacher : I'm just a bachelor man
Some of these days mama : you bound to understand
Now set down gal : stop your crazy ways
Got trouble in the land : you're going to need my help some day
Now when I want it : I want it awful bad
If I don't get it : you know it's going to make me mad
Said I asked my mama : to not to be so rough
She ain't the type : to keep on strutting her stuff
Says I asked my baby : not to be so mean
She acts like a woman : from down in New Orleans
Now come on baby : stop this up and down
Don't like to catch you : start to messing around

Now this big ship was a-rocking : and my body's filled with aches and pains
Now if I get across the Atlantic Ocean : good people I will not live to Spain
Now the big tide is rising : you better lower your anchors down
Now if we don't make the circle : we never will get back to New York town
Now why don't you people quit laughing : I feel mighty sad in my mind
Said this big fog go to rising : and a cyclone is right behind
Now I feels bad : nobody seems to want to go my way
Says this big ship going to leaking : right between midnight and day
Now I see something shining : daylight is breaking all around
Soon as we make a few more lurches : I will be right back in New York town

Captain rung the bell this morning : just at the break of day
Said now it's time for you to go rolling : buddy why don't you be on your way
Mama you can cook my breakfast : great God don't you burn my bread
Do and I'm going to take my black hand razor : I'm going to cut you on your doggone head
Now my captain done called me : Lord and I got to go
Because he's on his old black stallion : and he's riding from door to door
Now I will be so glad : when my payday comes
Says I'm getting so tired mama : rolling from sun to sun
Now I'm going to get up in the morning : do just like old Buddy Brown
Says I'm going to eat my breakfast : please and lay back down

Now my road is rocky : but it won't be rocky long
Says I been catching the devil : ever since my good gal been gone
Says my mama told me : Lord when I was quite a child
Son you must always remember : Lord that you was born to die
Now I got so many wagons : till I done cut that good road down
Because the little woman that I been loving : said she do not even want me around
Says she won't write me no letter : she won't send me no telegram
She just a hard-headed woman : and she don't even give a damn
Now I'm going to smoke my reefer : drink my good champagne and wine
Say I ain't going to let these hard-headed women : make me lose my mind

I believe to my soul : there's a black cat sleeping under my bed
Every time I get drunk : my woman wants to cut my head
She keeps me running : ducking and dodging all night long
Every time I get drunk : I don't mean to treat nobody wrong
Now listen here mama : I ain't going to do it no more
When I get full of my good whiskey : you got me running from door to door
Now I'm leaving you mama : Lord and it won't be long
Now if you don't believe I'm leaving : please count the days I'm gone
Now just as sure as a freight train : rolls up in the yard
Says I'm going to go far : take two dollars to send me a postal card

Well I dreamed last night now : that my old shack was falling down
And when I woke up this morning : my poor head was going round and round
Now I'm going to be a robber and a cheater : I'm going to take that to be my game
And when I make my black money : I'm going on back home to Mary Jane
Now when I was a schoolboy : I would not take no one's advice
Now I'm just a broke man : nobody seems to want to treat me right
Now my poor heart is aching : and I really don't know what to do
Says I got a strong notion : coming right on back home to you
Now I'm going to close conversation : and I have no more to say
And a since I been a broke man : nobody seems to want to go my way

Some of these days you're going to miss me : mama Lord when I'm gone
Now just go ahead and forget it : and try to carry my good works on
Now I'm going away mama : but I'll be back some day soon
Just don't lose your head : let no lowdown rounder have my room
Mama here I am : right back on the job again
Says I've had no loving : Lord since God knows when
Now you acted bad : and you don't obey my rules
Because I'm back home again : I'm going to take you to a brand new school
Now listen here mama : go ahead and set down and be yourself
But the next time I go strolling : just try to find you someone else

Now your ways and your actions : speaks almost as loud as words
Because your dreamy eyes told me something : Lord that I never heard
Now you know that you love me : mama why don't you tell me so
Because you always hanging around : knocking on my door
Every time I see you baby : my flesh begin to crawl
Says why don't you be good : but my mule is kicking in your stall
How can I miss you : mama Lord when I got dead aim
Says I feel so different : till this old world don't look the same
Now there's nothing that I can do : I did all in this world that I could
Now she's gone and left me : she didn't mean me no good

I'm getting so tired : of running from town to town
For when I wake up in the morning : my head is going around and around
Some of these days : Lord and it won't be long
Says I'm going to run lucky : and find me a happy home
Now I'm going to keep on traveling : till *such another* comes my way
Says my woman get a chance to see me : not until the sunshiny day
Now I been waiting for tomorrow : look like tomorrow ain't going never come
Every day seems like Monday : just at the rising sun
Now my poor heart is aching : and my head can't rest no more
Says I'm getting so tired : of running from door to door

Says I never missed my water : not until my well went dry
Says I never missed sweet Annie : not until she said goodbye
Hey Lord sweet mama : tell me when you're coming back again
Says I ain't had none of your loving : Lord since God knows when
Now the mailman he passed : but he did not leave no news
Says he left me standing here : with the doggone aching-heart blues
Well I ain't going to be no fool man : I'm going to hold up my head and walk
Says my woman get a chance to see me : but they all hear me when I talk
Says I holler in the morning : I begin to moan late at night
Says I got a hard-hearted woman : and she don't know how to treat me right

In the morning : right between midnight and day
I'm going to pack my suitcase : and start to drift away
My gal she got ways : just like a snake in the grass
If I don't leave here soon : my life won't never last
It's so hard : to get right up and change your mind
When someone that you love : has been left behind
Sooner or later : one of us has got to walk away
She says I don't mind you going : but please don't go away to stay
Now I don't care baby : if the wind don't never change
If your coming don't bring sunshine : it sure God will bring rain

Now there's trouble trouble : I been having all my days
Now it seems like troubles : going to put me in my lonesome grave
Now my woman she got ways : just like a wildcat in the woods
She always raising hell and disturbance : right here in my neighborhood
I'm scared to stay here : scared to leave this old bad-luck town
So when I wake up every morning : my head is going round and round
Now listen here people : I don't want no one's advice
I done changed my way of living : going to find someone to treat me right
I'm going to tell everybody : what bad luck I've had in my life
I'd kill my sister and my brother : not a woman *break my line*

Now my [old] heart is ticking : just like a clock up on the wall
Says I tried to be good : but my woman treats me like a dog
Now I've got my name written : right on my right arm
Every time I want to leave : I know she's got to come back home
Now you said that you loved me : what make you treat me so unkind
You just old hard-headed woman : but I believe you about to lose your mind
Now you can tell your kid-man : he needn't take it so doggone hard
Because if he messes with me : going to crack him right on his nog
Now that's all I got to say mama : I ain't going to let you worry my mind
When I go away to leave you : I will stop by to see you sometime

Way down in Mississippi : where I was bred and born
Reason : that will forever be my native home
And my poor mother's old : Lord and her hair is turning grey
I know it would break her heart : if she found I was barrelhousing this way
And I'm going to where : now the water drink like wine
Where I can be drunk there : and staggering all the time
And it ain't but the one thing now : Lord that worries my mind
That's a house full of women Lord : none in there is mine
And my friend passed me : and she never said a word
Nothing I had did : but was something she had heard

Ain't going to marry : neither settle down
I'm going to stay right here : till they tear this barrelhouse down
And I love you babe : and I tell the world I do
I don't love nobody : whole in this round world but you
Ain't no use of weeping : ain't no need of crying
For you've got a home : just as long as I got mine
Is you ever been lucky now : woke up cold in hand
I would call that now : nothing but a monkey-man
And I love you baby : you so nice and brown
Because you put it up solid : so it won't come down
Did you get that letter now : mailed in your back yard
It's a sad word to say : but the best of friends have to part

Paid my room rent last night : half past ten
Take my gal to the door : but she wouldn't go in
I take a gal for a ride : she tried to get rough
*How* I been in your doorway : strutting my stuff
Ain't these women funny : about the way they do
Start to loving a man : then go to dogging you
I buy you a cigarette : and I buy you snuff
I know doggone well now : when I get enough
Now make someone : to tell you *loves* every day
I know that's enough : to let you have your way
Mama you been just like : says a farmer's mule
Longer I live with you : harder you is to rule
I told my wife : if you want me to wait
You better stop your sister : from doing her *gait*

I woke up this morning : my good gal was gone
Stood by my bedside : and I hung my head and hung my head and moaned
I walked down the street : I couldn't be satisfied
I had the no no blues : I couldn't keep from I couldn't keep from crying
It ain't none of my business : but it sure ain't right
Take another man's gal : walk the streets all walk the streets all night
Take a mighty *pricky* woman : to treat her good man wrong
Take a mighty mean man : take another man's take another man's home
I'm a stranger here : I just blowed in your town
If I ask for a favor : don't turn me don't turn me down
I'm long and tall : like a cannonball
Take a long tall man : make a good gal make a good gal squall
If I mistreat you : I don't mean no harm
Because I'm a motherless child : don't know right from don't know right from wrong
I ain't no gambler : and I don't play no pool
I'm a rambling roller : jelly-baking jelly-baking fool
She's low and squatty : right down on the ground
She's a lightweighted mama : so I can bear so I can bear down
I'm a stranger here : I come in on the train
I long to hear : some good gal call my good gal call my name

I wonder : will a matchbox hold my dirty clothes
I haven't got so many : but I got so far to go
Women all singing the blues : I can't raise my right hand
What make a woman have them blues : well you know somebody's got her man
The blues is something : woman I ain't never had
Just get your *best friend's good man* : and do the best you can
A weak-minded woman : will let a rounder tear her down
And when she get in trouble : that rounder can't be found
She got up last night : she crawled around my bed
Going love you long time daddy : I guess I will see you dead
Woman take the blues : she going to buy her a paper and read
Man take them blues : he going to catch a train and leave
My gal got a mouth : like a lighthouse on the sea
Every time she smiles : she throws that light on me

Bad luck in my bed : bad luck's in my home
That's the reason why : singing this bad-luck moan
I got a gal : though she's a little bit up in years
But she sure knows how : how to shift her gears
Some like pigmeat : but hogmeat's what I crave
I believe : this sure going to carry me to my grave
Mmm : mama come to my rescue
I'm feeling so bad : till I don't know what to do
Well the chinch has moved in : all in my room
Somebody better come here : pretty doggone soon

When a man gets down : the trouble lasts always
Your gal will leave you : and be gone for days and days
Tell all you women : how to make a happy home
Keep you a workingman : and leave those sweet boys alone
There's coming a time : these women won't need no men
Their body washed up : and money'll come rolling in
When you think : your women always running hand to hand
You can bet your bottom dollar : one's got the other one's man
On one Monday morning : on my way to school
That's the Monday morning : I broke my mama's rule

Yonder she goes : with a broom in her hand
Sweep me off : for another man

I wonder : will a matchbox mama hold my dirty clothes
I ain't got so many : but I got so far to go
Women all singing the blues : I ain't raise my right hand
What make a woman have them blues : when she knows somebody's got her man
The blues is something : woman I ain't never had
Just get your *best friend's good man* : and do the best you can
A weak-minded woman : will let a rounder tear her down
And when she get in trouble : that rounder can't be found
She got up last night : she crawled around my bed
Going love you long time daddy : guess I will see you dead
Woman take the blues : she going to buy her a paper and read
Man take them blues : he going to catch a train and leave
My gal got a mouth : like a lighthouse on the sea
Every time she smiles : she throws that light on me

I got a gal : she got a Rolls Royce
She didn't get it all : by using her voice
I'm wild about my tuni : only thing I crave
Well sweet patuni : going to carry me to my grave
Every time : my gal walk down the street
All the boys holler : ain't tuni sweet
I got a gal : she lives up on the hill
You can't get her tuni : she got automobile
Well I woke up this morning : half past four
A long tall gal : rapping at my door
She was singing sweet patuni : only thing I crave
Well sweet patuni : going to carry me to my grave
If all these tuni : was brought to a test
A long tall gal : can *break* it the best
Telling all you men : I been well blessed
If I get what I want : you can have the rest

I got the blues for my baby : she got the blues for I say me
But I can't see my baby : and she can't see me
I'm going to be condemned : early tomorrow I say morn
But I am not guilty : because I ain't done nobody wrong
My crime my crime : I really can't understand
They got me accused of murder : and I never harmed a man
Will you please come down : on my trial day
So when I be condemned : you can wipe my tears away
They ain't no need to cry : no need to weep and moan
Just try to get somebody : to go on my bond
It's going to be weeping : I begin to moan
Said I'm a poor boy here : I sure ain't got no home
The jury found me guilty : the judge say listen here
It ain't no fine for you : get ready for the electric chair

But papa done got you : you've had your last chance
You going to miss me : baby when I'm gone
Won't be no need : a-sing this lonesome song

And you spent all my money : on your other man
When you in my presence : mama you giggles and laughs
And tell me so many ??? : that I have no need no cash

Said high sheriff been here : got my girl and gone
I said isn't it lonely : since I'm all alone
Well listen Mr : what have my baby done
I just want to know : if she done anybody wrong
They took her on down : to that big rock jail
And her crime was so evil : nobody will go her bail
You took your gun : made her raise her hand
And you went wrong : because she ain't never harmed a man
My babe in jail : I can't get no news
I don't get nothing : but the mean old high sheriff blues

Oh you used to told me : you could drive me like a cow
But now you can't drive me : because you don't know how
From now on mama : I tell you just like that
If you hit my dog : sure going to kick your cat
From now on mama : I ain't going to have no rule
I'm going to get hard-headed : and act just like a doggone mule
From now on mama : you going to do what I say
You must understand : you can't have your ways
From now on mama : this way you got of doing
Sugar you better stop that : Lord it's sure going to be your ruin
From now on mama : starting from this very day
I'm going to get someone : who can drive my blues away
I want her to drive them off : so they won't come back no more
From now on mama : I said I'm going to let you go

I saw you doing something : don't do it no more
Because if I catch you : baby walking slow
*Lord* took another man : *right across my face*
Then told me : that the one had took my place
You say you done quit me : now what should I do
Can't make up my mind : to love no one but you
Now you take him for your sweet : take me to be a slave
You better see the undertaker : get someone to dig your grave
You say your suitcase is packed : your trunks done gone
Better stop your bus : and bring it right back home
I knocked on your door : and I *quit quit quit*
Begged till daybreak : and I ain't got none yet

Big girl I love : live on Eighteenth Street
She got a new line : for every man she meets
To let her tell it : she ain't got no man
But she hangs around here : always raising sand
One day ??? : we're riding along
I asked her how about it : and she walked back home
She don't do this : she don't do that
Rub your hand down her back : she act like a cat
She ain't low and squatty : she ain't long and slim
Only way you'll get it : have to grab your lemon
*It ain't right* : and I don't have fun
This girl I love : won't give me none
I want it right now : please tell me can I get it
I better not catch : nobody else with it

My baby done quit me : talked all over town
And I'm too good a man : for to let that talk go around

One these days : Jack Frost said he sure going to tear you down
Now Mr Mr : please spare my life

If I should die : in the state of Arkansas
I want you to send my body : home to my mother-in-law
Said if she don't want it : baby give it to my ma
Said if my ma don't want it : baby give it to my pa
Said if my pa don't want it : baby give it to Abby Lee
Said if Abby don't want it : say give it to my used-to-be

Said I won't be worried : with these blues no I say more
Said it's traintime now : *said that* ring I did adore

Baby I been working : all this blasted year
I want to go home : ain't got no shoes to wear
The times so hard : can't get no work to do
And my hard luck mama : because I ain't got no shoes
I'm going to sit right down : hang my head and cry
I feel just like : I could lay right down and die
Sugar I will never : be contented here
I am so barefooted : ain't got no shoes to wear
My coat all busted : my pants all full of holes
Barefooted hungry and raggedy : doggone my hard-luck soul

I can't sleep no more : can't get her off my mind
Know I wants to see my baby : man only one more time
I treated her wrong : before she left my home
I guess I'm not her daddy : and she would not have been gone
I didn't know I loved my baby : till she packed her trunk to leave
I telephoned the undertaker : just come and bury me please
Might get a black cat bone : going to bring my baby back home
Lord and if that don't do it : might be one more rounder gone

I been a bad bad boy : didn't treat nobody right
They want to give me thirty-five years : some want to turn out my light
Judge please don't kill me : I won't be bad no more
And I will listen to anybody : something I ain't never done before
I'm sitting here in prison : with my black cap on
I want to speak to all you fast fellows : that you are in the wrong
Well I'm so sorry : every day that I was born
But God remember this : even when I'm gone
When they get you in jail : with your back turned to the wall
I ain't going to sing no more : baby that is all

Take your picture : make it in a frame
When you're gone : I'll see you just the same
Believe to my soul : my girl got a black cat bone
Treat me mean : and I won't let her alone
See that spider : climbing up the wall
Hunt some place : to get his ashes hauled
Treat my slippers : with some *hog eye* lard
Hear me tipping : towards my good gal's yard
Mama mama : please let me alone
In the corner : can get what I want

If you want a good woman : go to the Larkin Dam
You want to ruin your woman : take her to Birmingham
Have you ever waked up babe : between midnight and day
Turn over and grab the pillow : where you great gal used to lay
If you want a good woman : get one long and tall
When she go to loving : she make a panther squall
I'm motherless and fatherless : sister and brotherless too

I wake up this morning : blues all around my bed
Well I had a high fever : going up to my head

I'm got two women in the country : I'm got two women stays in town
Reason I consider it so careful : because men don't dog me around
They may be brownskin woman : with Georgia hair long as my own
They can do the best playing poker : you sure done lost your home
I don't want no jealous-hearted woman : who tries making up my bed
And she puts *straw* in your mattress : makes you wish you was dead

I'm going to leave here walking : going down Number Sixty-One
If I find my baby : we are going to have some fun
I walked Sixty-One Highway : till I gives out in my knees
*Every time* that M and O : when she came on that Santa Fe
That Sixty-One Highway : longest road I ever knowed
It runs to Atlanta Georgia : clean to the Gulf of Mexico
I'm going home : get my Bible and set down and read
I'm going to ask the good Lord : give me back my baby if he please

Who's going to be : in the second bamalong

Been to the nation : and I just got back
Didn't get no money : but I'll go to *there*
If you didn't want me : don't you dog me around
I didn't come here : to be nobody's dog
Just as sure as the sun : sets in the golden west
I got the one : that I love the best

Thought I heard : old K C when it blowed
She blowed like : it never blowed before
Oh it's coming a time : when a woman won't need no man
Honey I love : God knows I do
Sister : give me that long-distance phone
I'm going to talk : to that brown of mine

I've got the blues : on my mother's knee
And I know : she's got the blues for me
I've been thinking all day : thinking of the past
And I'm thinking : of my mother last
I received a letter : what do you suppose it read
Said come home : your poor old mother's dead
Said I grabbed a train : I went home a-flying
She wasn't dead : but she was slowly dying
Said run here daughter : fall down on your knees
Won't you song : Nearer My God to Thee
Fell down on my knees : I begin to moan
Yes dear mother : I'll try to sing that song
The tears rolled out : like a black shower of rain
Goodbye mother : I won't see you again
Then I scampered away : with fear in my heart
I had no mother : here to take my part

I been drifting and rolling : along the road
Looking : for my room and board
Like a log : I've been jammed on the bank
So hungry : I grew lean and lank
Get me a pick and shovel : dig down in the ground
Going to keep on digging : till the blues come down
I've got the blues : for my sweet man in jail
Now the judge : won't let me go his bail
I've been rolling and drifting : from shore to shore
Going to fix it : so I won't have to drift no more

I'm going away : it won't be long
I know you'll miss me : from singing this lonesome song
I'm going away : mmm I won't be long
And then you know : you must have done me wrong
My daddy got ways : like a baby child
Those doggone ways : are driving me wild
Those doggone ways : are driving me wild
And that is why : you never see poor Lottie smile
My heart aches so : I can't be satisfied
I believe : I'll take a train and ride
I believe : I'll take a train and ride
Because I miss my cruel daddy : from my side
I've got Cadillac ways : got some super ideas
I can't see : what brought me here
I can't see : what brought me here
It must have been : this new canned city beer
I'm lame and blind : can't hardly see
My doggone daddy : turned his back on me
Because I'm lame : I can't hardly see
I ain't got nobody : to really comfort me

I'm going away : it won't be long
I know you'll miss me : from singing this lonesome song
I'm going away : it won't be long
And then you know : you must have done me wrong
My daddy got ways : like a baby child
Those doggone ways : are driving me wild
Those doggone ways : are driving me wild
And that is why : you never see poor Lottie smile
My heart aches so : I can't be satisfied
I believe : I'll take a train and ride
I believe : I'll take a train and ride
Because I miss my cruel daddy : from my side
I've got Cadillac ways : got some super ideas
I can't see : what brought me here
I can't see : what brought me here
It must have been : this new canned city beer
I'm lame and blind : can't hardly see
My doggone daddy : turned his back on me
I'm lame : I can't hardly see
I ain't got nobody : to really comfort me

I been rolling and drifting : along the road
Just looking : for my room and board
Like a log : I've been jammed on the bank
So hungry : I grew lean and lank
Get me a pick and shovel : dig down in the ground
Going to keep on digging : till the blues come down
I've got the blues : for my sweet man in jail
And the judge : won't let me go his bail
I've been rolling and drifting : along the road
Going to fix it : I won't have to drift no more

Is it hopeless : when I lost my best friend

I'd just soon have my body : baby buried in the sea
I had trouble this morning : mailman didn't leave no mail
I can't see my baby : she's all locked up in jail
When trouble starts : it lasted so long
Look like everything happened : and everything goes wrong
Tell me baby : what trouble have done to me
Come and got my regular : then took my used-to-be

I can get my money : but trouble won't let it stay
Trouble gets on me : and my money gets away
I wonder why : trouble keeps on worrying me
I'd just soon : have my body baby buried in the sea
Trouble in the morning : noon and night
Seemed like I'm treated : every way but right
When trouble gets on me : it never ends
I get out of one thing : and back into something else again
Nobody knows : the trouble I do see
Nobody knows : but the good Lord and me

I woke up this morning : with rambling on my mind
And I lit out to walking : just to pass away the time
I rambled all night long : and I'm rambling again today
All I need is someone : drive my blues away
Come here baby : and let me be your man
I may not suit you : but I'll do the best I can

One day I sit thinking : when the rain pour down outside
And the more I thought : the more I began to cry
Today has been : a long old lonesome day
And it looks like tomorrow : going to be the same old way
My days seem lonesome : and my nights they are so long
I'll be mighty glad : when them old blue days are gone

I'm just sitting here thinking : of dear old sunny Tennessee
And wondering if my baby : is waiting there for me
I'm going : where the Monon crosses the L and N
And catch me a freight train : and go back home again
I'm going back south : where it's warm the whole year round
I'll be so glad : when my train pulls up in town

I'm going down to the river : just to see the water run
And to think about my troubles : and where all my money's gone
Times has got so hard : that I cannot find a job
And every morning : the rent man grabs on my doorknob
I'm getting so ragged : I ain't got no decent clothes
I ain't got nobody : ain't got nowhere to go
Now I'm worried : ain't no telling what I'm going to do
My friends don't know me : and I can't get a dime or two
Soon as hard time strike me : my baby puts me out
Now guess you know : what these hard time is all about

I left my baby : standing in the back door crying
Begging and pleading : don't you leave this time
Oh the sun's going to shine : in my back door some day
I wish I had somebody : to drive my blues away
Blues and trouble : both running hand in hand
If you ain't never had the blues : you just can't understand
You can always tell : when your woman's got another man
She will take your bad treatments : and do the best she can

I got a no-good woman : and she sure don't mean me no good
I hope there ain't another woman like her : in nobody's neighborhood
She leaves every morning : come back at the break of day
And when she comes in the morning : she ain't got a word to say
Every time I look at that woman : she's got a frown on her face
I believe that woman : done let my best friend take my place
Every evening : do you stop by my door
But since he's got my woman : she don't stop there no more
She's just a no-good woman : and I took her to be my friend
But she's taught me a lesson : about no-good women and men

Early this morning : my baby made me sore
I'm going away to leave you : ain't coming back no more
Tell me pretty mama : where did you stay last night
It ain't none of your business : daddy since I treat you right
When you see me sleeping : baby don't you think I'm drunk
I got one eye on my pistol : and the other on your trunk
I love you pretty mama : believe me it ain't no lie
The day you dare to quit me : baby that's the day you die

Early this morning : my baby made me sore
I'm going away to leave you : ain't coming back no more
Tell me pretty mama : where did you stay last night
It ain't none of your business : daddy since I treat you right
When you see me sleeping : baby don't you think I'm drunk
I got one eye on my pistol : and the other on your trunk
Love you pretty mama : believe me it ain't no lie
The day you try to quit me : baby that's the day you die

Grab your gal : fall in line
While I play : this rag of mine
Too tight : won't behave
Too tight : make you rave
Too tight : won't jump
Too tight : can't just once
Too tight : make you cry
Too tight : you want to die
Too tight : won't quit
Too tight : I'm singing it
Too tight : I'll confess
Too tight : it's a mess
Too tight : you hear me sing
Too tight : to shake that thing

I woke up this morning : worried in my mind
Thinking about : that girl I left behind
I'm worried now : I won't be worried long
The brownie I love : makes me sing this song
If the blues don't kill me : they will drill me through and through
Woman I love : don't know what to do
There's one thing in this world : I cannot understand
That's a bow-legged woman : crazy about a cross-eyed man

I'm feeling blue : lowdown as I can be
Come on gals : run and kiss poor me
I'm going downtown : to spread the news
My gal quit me : and I ain't got the blues
Come on gals : bob it up and down
But don't let me catch you : messing around

I'm going back to Tampa : to that girl I left behind
I'm going back to Tampa : just to kill my worried mind
Did you ever lie down at night : thinking about your brown
You commence rolling and tumbling : I guess I'm Tampa bound
The bridge washed out : the wire's all down
My gal is in the flood : and I'm Tampa bound
I got up this morning : put on my walking shoes
I'm going back to Tampa : just to kill my lowdown blues

Hey hey hey hey : hey hey hey hey
My Stonewall Street gal : makes me feel this a-way
You call me in the morning : you call me late at night
You swear that you love me : but you know you don't treat me right
I got the blues so bad : can feel them with my natural hand
I been your dog : ever since I been your man
I'm going to grab me a freight train : ride until it stops
I ain't going to stay around here : and be your stumbling block

Let me tell you mama : what my black dog done done to me
He chased me from my regular : now he's after my used-to-be
Black dog black dog : you caused me to weep and moan
You caused me : to leave my sweet old happy home
Black dog black dog : you forever on my mind
If you only let me : see my baby one more time
So long black dog : I'm quitting you on the fly
Because you got the nerve : to leave my good woman to cry

Ah : the rising sun going down
I ain't got nobody : since my baby's blowed this town
Ah : mama love me one more time
You give me a little chance : maybe you will change your mind
I done called you : till I almost lost my mind
I ain't going call no more : good man is hard to find
Ah : mama who can your regular be
I ain't got no regular : baby please take me
Take me : mama I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll get up every morning : work hard all day for you

I got the bad feeling blues : keeps me worried all the time
I can't get along : with that high brown gal of mine
Look a-here mama : you done throwed your papa down
I wouldn't hate it so bad : but the news all over town
Look a-here mama : what you want me to do
I work all the time : bring my money home to you
Lord Lord : your papa done going to stay
I never thought : you would treat your daddy this a-way
I got the bad feeling blues : keeps me so lowdown
I'm going to pack my grip : leave this lonesome town

Brownskin mama : what in the world you want me to do
You keep my poor heart aching : I'm blue through and through
I helped you when you were down : and could not help yourself
Now I'm down : you want to help somebody else
You can go : do anything that you want to do
Some day you want me : mama and I won't want you
You treat me lowdown and dirty : baby that's all you do
But some old rainy day : it's coming home to you
My mind's all churned up : that's why I'm all confused
That's the reason why : I'm moaning these brownskin mama blues

Keep on walking and walking : talking to myself
Gal I love : with somebody's else
I got the hard road blues : walking on down the line
Maybe some day : my gal must change her mind
It's a hard hard road : when your baby done throwed you down
Going to keep on walking : from town to town
It's been a long long time : since I seen my baby's face
And I don't see her joker : stand to my place
I'm going to find my baby : don't say she can't be found
Going to walk this hard hard road : until my mustache drags the ground

Hey hey : your daddy's feeling blue
I'm worried all the time : can't keep you off my mind
Hey hey : love you till the day you die
Nobody but me : you know the reason why
Hey hey : your daddy lonesome for you
I ain't going to tell no lie : your daddy's about to die
Hey hey : I'm lonesome night and day
I told you what I said : don't you drive the blues away

You going to quit me baby : good as I been to you

Give you my money honey : to buy your shoes and clothes

You going to quit me baby : put me out-of-doors

Six months on the chain-gang : believe me 'tain't no fun

The day you quit me baby : that's the day you die

Jailhouse ain't no place baby : believe me 'tain't no lie

Down south : on Wabash Street
Everybody : you chance to meet
They're doing it : night and day
See : if it will drive your blues away
Every little kid : that you meet
In the alley : in the street
Grab me mama : hold me tight
Let's mess around : the rest of the night
Throw your hands : way up high
Grab me mama : make me cry
People come : from miles around
Get on Wabash : break them down

There's no need of you dogging me : mama I ain't done nothing to you
If you keep on dogging me : no telling what I'll do
You dog me in the morning : mama you dog me late at night
If you keep on dogging daddy : I sure ain't going to treat you right

For years and years : I been your hard-working mule
I may be crazy : but I ain't no doggone fool
You used to be sugar : but you ain't sweet no more
Better keep your other man : from hanging around my door
You used to be kind : now you begun to change
You treat me : like an old dog got the mange
Goodbye mama : you ain't the same no more
Don't come back : but treat me like you did before

It's a hard hard time now : good man can't get no dough
All I do for my baby : don't satisfy her no more
I ain't got no job : now you going to put me down
You going to quit me baby : for a hard-working clown
Time is so hard now : maybe things will change some day
And when I get a job : maybe you will change your way
Don't quit me baby : because I can't find no work to do
Because all the dirt you done for me : it's coming back home to you
I used to be a joker : now I'm going to make a change
I'm going to get me a job : keep coal in your cold kitchen range

I love my whiskey : crazy about it as I can be
But my new bootlegger : well he's about to poison me
Took one drink last night : and it made me go stone blind
Got to run away : leave my sweet mama behind
Sometime one drink : make me act like a doggone fool
But two or three drinks : make me kick like a doggone mule
Mama mama : don't treat your papa mean no more
Get full of my bootleg whiskey : make you fly through the door
I'm a good man when I'm sober : but Lord Lord when I'm drunk
If you see me reeling : mama go hide in your trunk

I got a sweet mama : she ain't low at all
She got the kind of loving : will make a panther squall
She got Elgin movements : and a twenty-year guarantee
I bet you my last dollar : she don't put them jinx on me

Walking walking : talking to myself
Wondering if I die : would my baby love somebody else
Sighing and crying : broke down with the blues
My clothes are worn out : holes all in my shoes
Walking across the country : trying to get a stake
Because my baby : want every cent I make
Tired and hungry : I've been walking many days
Wondering : if my baby would stop her hateful ways
Walking across the country : with my head bowed down
A woman can still make a man : act like a clown

Mr police captain : listen to my plea
I want to make my baby : come back home to me
Give me a search warrant : and a great big hound
I'm going to find my baby : if I have to track her down
I know where she's at : but her man won't let me in
All I want is a search warrant : and a bottle of gin
I'm going to get running drunk : and go into that place
And that backbiting man : better not show his face
I love my baby : but she treat me so unkind
If she thinks she can quit me : she really have lost her mind

I got a notoriety woman : she about to drive me wild
Beside that woman : sits ever meek and mild
That woman is like a tiger : got ways like a bear
Carries a gun in her pocket : a dagger in her hair
To keep her quiet : I knocked her teeth out her mouth
That notoriety woman : is known all over the South
I can't get along with her : and I can't leave her alone
Because she knows just how to make me : come back home
She likes to fight : she likes to break them down
Everybody knows : when my notoriety woman come to town

Listen folks : to my moan
I'm going to tell you : about Sally Jones
I'm a man : play one gal
And that's : my loving Sal
She stepped out : I could see
He tried : to two-time me
So I thought : that I'd found out
What this man : all about
He was tall : he was thin
Drinks ??? : but *sips her* gin
Thought I'd catch her : when I walked in
Find her : loving my brother Jim
He pulled out a gun : said she was through
I'm going : to Chicago you
He started to shoot : the gun wouldn't go
I said that's all : I want to know
We got married : had a baby lamb
But that baby : looked like her iceman
When the rooster saw the eggs : and they was red
He walked across the road : and knocked the peacock dead
She's gone away : boys and I'm glad
Making : another poor fool sad
Six men are in jail : faces to the wall
But that gal : was the cause of it all

I love to gamble : and gambling's all I do
And when I lose : it never makes me blue
I gambled away my money : and I gambled away my shack
Same way I lost it : same way I'll get it back
I won a woman : in a poker game
I lost her too : win another one just the same
Sometime I'm rich : sometime I ain't got a cent
But I've had a good time : everywhere I went
Got a new mama : ain't going to gamble her away
Going to keep her with me : each and every day

I had a fall : five to twenty-one
When I get back : we going to have some fun
Baby baby : tell me the true facts
Will you be waiting : when I get back
I told the warden : you pay my fine
It didn't seem : that he paid me no mind
The good things you have done : I can't forget
If you quit me baby : it will be my death
I love you baby : whole heart and soul
Stand by me : until I get my parole
Be careful baby : while I'm gone
You can't be good : I'll be gone too long
Going away : and how happy I will be
I know : still love me

Went home last night : my baby won't let me in
She made me mad : and I've got in my gin
I been drunk so long : dizzy all the time
And I found out : whiskey ain't no friend of me
When I die : folks without a doubt
You won't have to do nothing : but pour me out
I can't sleep : and I can't eat a thing
The woman I love : has driven me to drink
I'm deep down in a hole : somebody else is up
Getting sick and tired : of fighting that jug

Hookworm in your body : and your food don't do you no good
Same way with a rounder : come in a nice neighborhood
Dirty old hookworm : got into my room
Causes me to walk : groan and moan
Man like a hookworm : got a hold to my baby
He got to *point it fast* : people and I don't mean maybe
Never can tell : what a hookworm man will do
Take your baby : and make her stop loving you
I'm going to leave my baby : and let her have her way
She want me back some day : when he throws her down
Mmm : mmm
Her man like a hookworm : taking a hold to my babe

There's : a great big mystery
And it surely : is worrying me
The little girl : about four feet four
Come on papa : and give me some more
I went out : and walked around
Somebody yelled : said look who's in town
Went to church : put my hat on the seat
Lady sat on it : said daddy you sure is sweet
I said sister : I'll soon be gone
Just give me that thing : you setting on
Then I got : put out of church
Because I talk : about diddie wa diddie too much

Got my gal : took a chance
We went : to a midnight dance
Too tight : it's a mess
Too tight : it's the best
Too tight : it's a wow
Too tight : I'll show you how
Too tight : stepping out
Too tight : hear me shout
Too tight : it's hot stuff
Too tight : can't get enough
Too tight : it's too bad
Too tight :
Too tight : sick in bed
Too tight : went to my head

All my life : I been a traveling man
Staying alone : and doing the best I can
I shipped my trunk : down to Tennessee
Hard to tell : about a man like me
I met a gal : I couldn't get her off my mind
She passed me up : says she didn't like my kind
I'm scared to bother : around her house at night
Got a police dog : craving for a fight
His name is rambler : and when he gets a chance
He leaves his mark : on everybody's pants
Guess I'll travel : I guess I'll let her be
Before she sics : her police dog on me

Packing my duffle : going to leave this town
And I'm going to hustle : to catch that train southbound
I got the Georgia blues : for the plow and the hoe
Walked out of my shoes : over this ice and snow
Tune up the fiddle : dust the cat and bow
Put on the griddle : and open the cabin door
I thought I was going : to the northland to stay
South is on my mind : my blues won't go away
Potatoes in the ashes : possum on the stove
You can have the hash : but please leave me the claw
Chicken on the roof : and melons on the vine
I'll be glad : to get back to that Georgia gal of mine

Numbers numbers : about to drive me wild
Thinking about the money : that I should have had
I dreamed last night : the woman I love was dead
If I had played the dead row : I would come out ahead
I act like a fool : and played on three six nine
Lost my money : and that gal of mine
I played on clearing house : couldn't make a grade
Lord think of the money : that I should have made
I begged my baby : let me in her door
Wanted to put my twenty-five fifty seventy-five : in her seven seventeen twenty-four
I want fifteen fifty : and see if it won
I'm going to keep playing policy : till some good luck comes

Listen everybody : I'm going to sing a song
It won't be dirty : and it won't be long
When you want some whiskey : right off the *stove*
Go over : and see Miss Stella Gold
The gals from the alley : slipping all around
Telling everybody : they're leaving town
I got a yellow gal : and a brown named Mame
But the best I've ever had : was the old Crow Jane
Met a funny fellow : he didn't like girls
Painted his face : and with his hair all curls
I'm staying with a woman : about fifty-two
I thought she was too old : I'm telling you

I caught a stranger in my house : and I busted his head with a club
I lay him out cold : with his heels in a tub
I seen the sheriff coming : and I jumped for the door
But I jumped too late : the sheriff had done jumped before
They buried a man Thursday : just two short days you see
And it makes me wonder : what they going to do to me
I killed a man : and that's the how and how
I'm sitting here wondering : if a woman's worth it now
Mmm : rope stretching all day long
In just a few more days : I won't be able to sing my song

Don't trust no woman : who mistreats her man
When you think she's in your kitchen cooking : she's got a stranger by the hand
Ain't no need of you chasing women : brother if you really haven't got the cash
Other men get all the chicken : and all you get is hash
I have a lot of woman : but I sure don't want one now
She always milks me dry : better than you ever milk a cow
Mmm : rope stretching all day long
I'm singing now mama : because it won't be long
It wouldn't be so bad : if the rope would just get slack
I wouldn't mind at all : but I just got a crick in my back
When it's all over mama : and you're all alone by my side
Just keep the flies from buzzing by me : and then I will be satisfied

All last winter : and all last fall
I didn't have nobody : to worry me at all
No need running : holding out your hand
I can get a woman : same as you can a man
When I first met you : you had your diamonds on
Since I done left you : you've got them all in pawn
No need a-running : hollering and crying
I'll take you back baby : if you was dying
Come on daddy : and tell me one more time
When I left : I didn't have my right mind
Ain't no need of sitting : with my head hung down
Your black man : ought to get on out of town

I was standing in my back door : looking at the evening sun go down
I was standing there wondering : if my woman was in this town
She left me this morning : she carried away all my clothes
I'm going to find that woman : I don't care where she goes
She sobbed when she told me : I just could not change my mind
I was loving that woman : I know she was quitting me all the time
Honey I went to the fortuneteller : asked her where had my baby gone
She left me this morning : I hadn't done nothing wrong

Going up Coal River : coming down no more
Going to leave your town pretty baby : stop knocking on your back door
Across deep water : ain't no skiffs around
The ??? won't bring ??? : just let her sink on down
My mama told me baby : my papa told me too
Never let a fat little woman : going have no place to *spoon*
Don't want no woman : got hair like horse's mane
Woman's so doggone evil : want every woman's man
Ooh : broke down in tears today
I got the blues so bad pretty mama : I can't *gee* away

Fourteenth Street women : don't mean no man no good
Go out and get full of liquor : wake the whole neighborhood
Let me tell you mama : like the Dago told the Jew
If you don't want me : it's cinch I don't want you
There's two kind of nations : I sure can't understand
That's Chinese women : and a doggone Dago man
I was born in Texas : I raised in Tennessee
You *missed a real brownie* : when you picked all over me
I feel like jumping : through the keyhole in your door
Told me this morning : you didn't want me no more
I feel like snapping : my big gun in your face
Had the nerve to tell me : another man's got my place

Let me tell you : what sweet patuni do
It take your money : and stay all night for you
Well I'm wild about my tuni : the only thing I crave
Sweet patuni : is going to follow me to my grave
I went up on the mountain : looked down in the deep blue sea
A big fat man : was trying to play with me
If I could holler : like a mountain jack
Go out on the mountain : call sweet patuni back
Sweet patuni man : I can't understand
He got ways like a barber : he's a full-blown man

Down in the levee : Camp Number Nine
You can pass my house : honey you can hear me cry
I never had no blues : *sure am*
I'm going to leave this camp : you *can go starry* here
I ain't found no doctor : ain't no doctor in this whole round world
Just to cure the blues : the blues of the leveecamp girl

Hey Jim Tampa : you treat your women so mean
You treat your *townie* : like a woman you ain't never seen
Womens all know my name : call him Mr Tampa Long
He made so much money : women when the weather was warm
My man's got five women : I can call them by their natural names
And all them are cheaters : sounds just the same
It must be a black cat bone : jomo can't work that hard
Every time I wake up : Jim Tampa's in my yard
I can stand right here : five miles down the road
Give a gander the way : Jim Tampa used to go

It ain't nobody in town : can grind their coffee like mine

I drink so much coffee : till I grind it in my sleep
And when you get like that : you know it can't be beat
It's so doggone good : that it made made me bite my tongue
Going to keep it for my daddy : ain't going to give nobody none
I ain't ever loved it : this a-way before
And I hope to the Lord : I won't love it anymore
I got so now : that I can't control my mind
I go to bed blue : and I get up crying
It's so doggone good : it made me talk out of my head
And it's better to me : than any I ever had
Now I grind my coffee : till it's two and three dollars a pound
And there ain't no more : cheap like mine in town
It's so doggone good : till it make you bite your tongue
And I'm a coffee-grinding mama : won't you let me grind you some

You must bring me a job : or money from anywhere
Because I can get your kind of loving : in the streets just anywhere
You come home every day : looking for your stew and beans
And you have got more nerve : than any pot hound I've ever seen
Now you take your money : and you have your fun
You don't have nothing : when house rent comes
And I'm through : cooking you stew and beans
And you can eat more neckbones : than any man I've ever seen
Now if you want me baby : you got to make your *for sure* down
And you got to put your money : down where I got mine
Now you laying up in my bed : between my two white sheets
I can't see or smell nothing : but your doggone feet
And I'm through : trying to make a man of you
And if you can't bring a job : don't you look for your daily stew
I worked hard from Monday : until late Saturday night
And you's a dirty mistreater : you ain't treating me right
And I'm through : cooking you stew and beans
And you's a dirty pot hound : dirtier than any man I seen

Look here papa : I don't mean no harm
Come get some Georgia grind : to carry the good work on
The thing I do : it's mighty fine
And the mens pays their ??? : all the time
When you got to doing it : it's a one-way strand
Got to do my Georgia grind : like a natural man
All you got to do : is to fall in line
Put your right hand up : and your left one behind
If you want to learn : you got to pay
Because I ain't going to give : my Georgia grind away
If you do it once : you'll do it twice
And it's mighty fine I tell you : if you do it right
I'm talking about my Georgia : I do mean grind
And if something bothers you baby : it will satisfy your worried mind
Some likes it slow : some likes it fast
But I like my Georgia grind : at half and half
Come past my house : and hear me cry
Big *bad* daddy : won't you take your time
I'm going back to Georgia : where I can have my fun
Going down in Georgia : where I get my good grinding done

Sometimes I'm up : sometimes I'm down
I can't make my living : around this town
Because tricks ain't working : tricks ain't working no more
And I got to make my living : don't care where I go
I need shoes on my feet : clothes on my back
Get tired of walking these streets : all dressed in black
Because tricks ain't working : tricks ain't working no more
And I see four or five good tricks : standing in front of my door
Please have mercy : bad luck's on my head
Four or five good tricks : is all the money I need
Because tricks ain't working : tricks ain't working no more
And I can't get a break : don't care where I go
I got a store on the corner : selling stuff cheap
I got a market across the street : where I sell my meat
This way of living : sure is hard
Ducking and dodging : the Cadillac squad
Because tricks ain't working : tricks ain't working no more
And if you think I'm lying : follow me to the door

I'd rather be sloppy drunk : than anything I know
And another half a pint : will see me go
I love my moonshine whiskey : better than I do my man
You can have your beer and your bottle : give me my cool kind can
I'd rather be sloppy drunk : sitting in the can
Than to be at home : rolling with my man
Mmm : bring me another two-bit pint
Because I got my habits on : I'm going to wreck this joint
I been on this sloppy drunk : for a solid year
And when I can't get my whiskey : bring me my cool can beer
My good man quit me : for somebody else
And I'm sloppy drunk : drinking by myself

I'm doing something now : I ain't never done before
Going to do it this time : ain't going to do it no more
My alley boogie: only thing I choose
And it's the only thing I do : to drown away by blues
I boogie all night : all the night before
When I woke up this morning : I want to boogie some more
Old alley boogie : only thing I crave
I can do my alley boogie : so many different ways
I got a bed in my bedroom : a pallet on my floor
Got to do the alley boogie : everywhere I go
Because I'm wild about my boogie : only thing I crave
Good alley boogie : will carry me to my grave
Mama loves my boogie : papa loves it too
And it runs in my family : that's all I like to do
I'm wild about my boogie : only thing I crave
I'm going to do my boogie : the rest of my days
Papa got a watch : mama got a ring
Sister got a hump : from really boogying that thing
I'm wild about my boogie : only thing I choose
Now she got to do the boogie : to buy her alley baby some shoes
Now I done sung this song : until I quit
And there ain't nobody : ??? no alley boogie yet
And I'm wild about my boogie : only thing I crave
I been doing my alley boogie : I been boogying all of my days

I got a sweet black angel : I like the way he spread his wings
And I'm crazy about him : he spreads so much joy in everything
If I ask him for a dime : he gives me a ten dollar bill
Yes he does everything : to keep my wants filled
If my black angel would leave me : I believe that I would die
And if I see him looking at another woman : I just scream and cry
I love my black angel : and I want him by myself
Lord I don't want him spreading his wings : over no one else
Womens don't bother my black angel : don't bother him in any way
I'll serve ninety-nine years in jail : most any day
I'm wild about my black angel : I like the way he spread his wings
He's got a new way of getting goose : and he sure can shake that thing

Times is done got hard : money's done got scarce
Stealing and robbing : is going to take place
Because tricks ain't working : tricks ain't working no more
And I'm going to rob somebody : if I don't make me some dough
I'm going to do just like a blind man : stand and beg for change
Until these arresting officers : change my tricking name
Because tricks ain't working : tricks ain't working no more
And I've got to make my living : don't care where I go
I'm going to learn these working tricks : what it's all about
I'm going to get them in my house : and ain't going to let them out
Because tricks ain't working : tricks ain't working no more
And I can't make no money : don't care where I go
I got up this morning : with the rising sun
Been working all day : and I ain't caught a one
Because tricks ain't working : tricks ain't working no more
And I can't make a dime : don't care where I go
I got up this morning : feeling tough
I've got to call in my tricks : in the rough rough rough
Because tricks ain't working : tricks ain't working no more
And I've got to change my luck : if I have to move next door

The train I ride : is eighteen coaches long
And the man that I love : done been here and gone
I hate to hear : that T and N O blow
Puts my mind on the wander : makes me want to go
Going to beat the train to the crossing : going to burn the trestle down
That's the onliest way : I can keep my man in town
He's a railroad man : and he sure do love to ride
If he don't ride that T and N O : he sure ain't satisfied
Going to fall down on my knees : pray to the Lord above
Please send me back : the only man I love

Got up this morning : by the rising sun
Didn't have no whiskey : I tried to buy me some
I use my Skeet and Garret : *feed* it everywhere
Lord I like them baking powder blues : and I sure don't care
Dice jumped to hustle Lord : I swear my money don't lose
I got to win tonight : and buy this baking powder man some shoes
Play them blues boy : and don't play them so slow
Because I'm going to give you some more money : and I'm going to give it to you sure

You may be beautiful : but baby you got to die some day
And you going to reap what you sow : for treating me this a-way
When the sun rose this morning : I was laying in my floor crying
And I've done got tired : of being dogged all the time
Tell me baby : what fault do you find in me
You don't treat me : like I'm no human being
Love hides all faults : make you do things you don't want to do
When you love someone : and that someone don't love you

I'm lonesome I'm lonesome : and I got them lonesome midnight blues
And I'm blue to my heart : my man I hate to lose
Blues and trouble : have overtaken me
And I've got those midnight blues : blue as I can be
Late last night : when my clock was striking three
My daddy was leaving : and the blues had me

Just one thing : I want my man to know
I ain't going to be : his lowdown dog no more
He gets up every morning : and before he goes
Say he don't want me to put my head : out of my front door
He won't buy me no shoes : he won't buy me no clothes
And he's got so lowdown : he wants to put me outdoors
I ain't got no coal : I ain't got no wood
And you know by that : that man don't mean me no good
I ain't got no flour : I ain't got no lard
And he knows doggone well : the times is done got hard

Some folks say black is evil : but I will tell the world they're wrong
Because I'm a sealskin brown : and I been evil ever since I been born
I a-scared to trust a rabbit : and I won't even trust a squirrel
And I won't bat my eyes : because I might lose sight on this whole round world
I've got a head like a freight train : and I walk just like a grizzly bear
And I use my Skeet and Garret : and I keep my ??? everywhere
They call me Pig Iron Sally because I live in Slag Iron Alley : and I'm evil and mean as I can be
And I ain't going to let nobody : put that doggone thing on me
I ain't nothing but a mistreater : baby and it ain't no joke
And if you don't believe I'm dirty : you can watch my bogus stroke

I hate that train : that they all call the M and O
It took my baby away : and he ain't coming back to me no more
When he was leaving : I couldn't hear nothing but that whistle blow
And the man at the throttle : Lord he wasn't coming back no more
He had his head in the window : that man the drivers roll
They are going away baby : and doggone your bad-luck soul
Now I'm so worried : and I'm so full of gloom
And deep down in my heart : ain't nothing but a lover's ruin
I was sorry : I was sorry sorry to my heart
To see that M and O train : and me and my daddy part

I worked all the winter : and I worked all the fall
I got to wait until spring : to get my ashes hauled
And now I'm tired : tired as I can be
And I'm going back home : where these blues don't worry me
I'm a free-hearted woman : I let you spend my dough
And you never did win : you kept on asking for more
And now I'm tired : I ain't going to do it no more
And when I leave you this time : you won't know where I go
My house rent's due : they done put me outdoors
And here you riding around here : in a V-Eight Ford
I done got tired : of your lowdown dirty ways
And your sisters say you been dirty : dirty all your days
I never will forget : when the times was good
I caught you standing out yonder : in the piney woods
And now I'm tired : tired as I can be
And I'm going back south : to my used-to-be

Sweet man sweet man : what makes you candy taste so hard
And I would come to see you : but your woman is got me barred
He caught the Frisco he caught the Frisco : and I just can't keep from crying
And if he don't come back : I will lose my worried mind
He is a rambler he is a rambler : and he is never satisfied
And I know he was a rambler : when he caught that train to ride
I'm going to find him I'm going to find him : with my smoking forty-five
Because you know I love that man : he so hard to find
He's gone he's gone : and he's forever on my mind
And I want to see my man : because because he's so good and kind

A woman gets tired : of one man all the time
And don't care what you give her : you can't change her rambling mind
Don't never think : you got a whole woman by yourself
Because there never was a woman : didn't love somebody else
I ain't never loved : just one man in my life
Because this kind of love I got : I can love the same way twice
Some womens like two men : some womens they like three
But I like as many men : I see is good to me

Way down in Boogie Alley : ain't nothing but skulls and bones
And when I get drunk : who's going to take me home
I'm going to stop my man : from running around
Because down in Boogie Alley : is where he can be found
He goes down in Boogie Alley : house number three
And when he gets down there : the womens won't let him come to see me
I went down in Boogie Alley : with my razor in my hand
And the blues struck : I brought back my man
If you go in Boogie Alley : you better take you forty-four
The womens will get your man down there : and they won't let him go

When you come to my house : come down behind the jail
I got a sign on my door : barbecue for sale
I'm talking about my barbecue : only thing I crave
And that good-doing meat : going to [carry, take] me to my grave
I'm selling it cheap : because I got good stuff
And if you try one time : you can't get enough
I'm talking about barbecue : only thing I sell
And if you want my meat : you can come to my house at twelve
Now some like it hot : some like it cold
Some take it : any way it's sold
Some people wants it : some people don't
If you buy my barbecue : it just won't don't don't don't
Some people wants to know : the regular price
Fifty-five cents : you can get some twice
And I'm talking about my barbecue : only thing I sell
And you can get my meat : any night at twelve

Jump steady daddy : please take your time
You got a year and a day : to satisfy my mind
Love me daddy : love me all the time
And if you love me like I tell you : you'll be the jump-steady man of mine
Jump-steady got to jumping : jumping in the room
And I got crazy about him : because he could strut his stuff
Now when jump-steady starts to jumping : he does it slow
He goes from the top : down to the floor
Ooh : just can't let him go
Because he jumps better : than any man that I know
He don't work on no rock pile : he don't tote no slag
And the way he jumps steady : it's just too bad

I went to bed last night : and the blues wouldn't let me rest
Because I ain't been used : to sleeping by myself
Oh blues oh blues : blues don't you see
You are carrying me down : blues you trying kill poor me
Now blues and trouble : go walk hand in hand
I never had these blues : until my best friend loved my man
She may have loved him one time : but that one man she can't hold
Because it's ??? *in Texas* : that I could sell fast jellyroll
He puts his arms around me : like the ring around the good Lord's sun
Said he ain't had no woman to love him : Lord like I done

A man say I had something : look like new
He want me to trade a *cam* : for some of my stew
Say he's going up the river : tried to sell his sack
He would pay me for my stuff : when the boat get back
I got good stew : and it's got to be sold
The price ain't high : I want to get you told
Go on up the river : man and sell your sack
It will be stew meat here : baby when the boat get back
Now look here man : what you want me to do
Give you my stew meat : and credit you too
I credit one man : it was to my sorrow
It's cash today : credit tomorrow
Now it's ashes to ashes : dust to dust
You try my stuff one time : you can't get enough

Good morning skin game : hollering skin game please last
I done staked my man to win : and I hope my money will pass
He done pawned my house : he got my life at stake
And I got to get it back : with that money he gamble and make
He never lost no money : until he drew that black queen of spades
And my man was in need of begging : he was in hard luck that very day
When he come back to me : got a dollar two
I want him to go back to that skin game : and see what he can do
If my man : he could only win my money back
I would take a walk downtown : buy me a brand new pair of shoes and hat

I'm worried now babe : I won't be worried long
Now when we is all going together : it's got to be carried on
Now did you get that letter : baby that I wrote to you
Oh you sitting in the shade baby : I declare you just won't do
Now I say once ain't forever : say but two time ain't for twice
Now when you get a good woman : you just won't treat her right
Mmm : Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
Now if I can't be your regular mama : I sure ain't going to be your dog

Now a yellow gal rides in an automobile : a brownskin gal rides the same
A black gal *will tell you* an old hay wagon : she's getting by just the same
A yellow gal drinks good old whiskey : a brownskin gal drinks the same
But a black gal drinks shoe polish : she's getting drunk just the same
A yellow gal will bite you she will pop you with a stick : a brownskin gal bites the same
But a black gal get a rusty razor and run you all over town : and you know that woman raises hell just the same
Now a yellow gal will kiss you she will kiss you awful sweet : a brownskin gal do the same
But a black gal spit bacca juice *shoo* snuff all on your lips : oh loving you just the same

Sitting down here thinking : yes babe I believe I better go
You know I believe I'll go down : that long long old dusty road
Now that Eighty Highway : is the longest highway that I know
Running all the way from Frisco Texas : *right cross* the Atlantic on the other *water course*
That church bell was beginning to tone : yes some other good gambler's gone
You know I wouldn't hate it so bad : but that Eighty Highway so long
You women fuss and argue with your good man : when you know you don't do right yourself
You know when I look for you at night : way down on Eighty Highway with someone else
Yes if you get in trouble : call on a *car* about forty-five
Baby now I just open up my chifforobe : and you'll see where my dollar lies

Never mind : honey never mind
Never mind : there's time to shine
You said you loved me : you know you told a lie
Oh never mind : never mind
I'm just a good woman : baby gone astray
Drinking charcoal liquor : throwing myself away
But never mind : there's time to shine
Spread your heart : babe just like mine

Now you tell me mama : do you think that's right
You with your kid all day : and run to me at night
Now my regular woman : totes my pocket change
And my sometime woman : wants to do the same
And you better not let : my regular catch you here

Because it ain't no telling : what she might do
Now she might cut you : and she might shoot you too
Now she's the meanest woman : that I've ever seen
And when I asked for water : give me gasoline
Now if you want your woman : to look like the rest
You buy her high brown powder : and Farmer's Skin Success
Now I got four or five puppies : and got one shaggy hound
It takes all them dogs : to run my woman down

I said the woman I'm loving : caught the train and gone
Got the lowdown feeling : I sure won't be here long
Now I went to the station : fold my arms and moan
Asked the operator : how long my rider been gone
Let me tell you : what that dirty train will do
Take your last rider Lord : blow black smoke on you
Ain't got no special : got no trifling kind
Ain't got nobody mama : *she has rock the ship*
Lord take me rider : take me to your hand
Let me in your darkest corner woman : hide me from your man
You don't want me rider : please don't dog me around
Just like you found me : you took and threw me down
Ask you to forgive me : darling if you please
Mama sure as I told you : I fall down on my knees

Now I tell you mama : now I'm sure going to leave this town
Because I been in trouble : ever since I set my suitcase down
Now you don't believe I'm leaving : just watch the train I'm on
And you don't believe I'm lucky : just count the days I'm gone
Now I ain't going to be : your teasing brown no more
Sugar the way you do me : you make my blood run cold
Now before I stay here mama : and be treated this a-way
Now I'll let some freight train : *throw me in the sea*
Mmm Lord oh Lord oh : oh Lord oh Lord oh Lord
Now the woman I'm loving : she treat me like a mangy dog
Now look a-yonder sugar : where the rising sun done gone
I can't live over here mama : a long way from my home

Won't you tell me mama mama : what have I said *or done*
For you treat me : like my sugar just ain't *hard*
Mama mama mama : you sure can worry me
*I ain't seen* none of my best woman : since my old-time used-to-be
Now you see my rider now : I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll rob and steal : and I'll bring it home to you
See [how] the sun went down mama : left it so lonesome here

Mama this lonesome place : don't seem like home to me


Lord it's soon in the morning : going to believe I'll leaving here

Down so long : down don't worry me

Don't believe I'm sinking : believe what a hole I'm in
You don't believe I loved you : think what a fool I been
Went to the graveyard : fell down on my knees
I said Lord have mercy : on this lonesome place
Went to the graveyard : peeped in my rider's face
Says I love you rider Lord : just can't take your place
Thousands of people mmm : around the burying ground
Just to see the ??? : let my rider down
Felt so sorry mmm : till they let her down
Lord my heart felt sorry : tears come rolling down
Tell me mama : what's the matter now
Trying to quit your daddy Lord : and you don't know how
Tell me mama : on your worried mind
If I don't get no better mama : believe I'm going I'm going

I've been down so long : down don't worry me

Don't believe I'm sinking : believe what a hole I'm in
You don't believe I love you Lord : think what a fool I been
Went to the graveyard : fell down on my knees
Hollered Lord have mercy : on this lonesome place
Thousands of people : round the burying ground
Just to see the ??? : let my rider down
Felt so sorry : till they let her down
Lord my heart struck sorrow : tears come rolling down
Love you mama : till the sea go dry
Lord I love you rider Lord : till the day you die
Anybody ask you : who wrote this worried song
Tell them you don't know the writer : he'd rather had his happy song

Woke up this morning : mama was treating me night and day
I reached for my sugar : and the fool had stoled away
Worried now mama : but I shan't be very long
Mama this the way I be treated : be on the county farm
Wouldn't treat a dog : babe like you treat me

Woke up soon this morning : with my face up to the ground
I didn't have no sugar : not to pick up in my arms
Mama that's all right : sugar that's all right for you
Now you know you got me : just the way you do

Woman woman woman woman : Lord what in the world you trying to do
Baby the way you treat me : break my heart in two
I got a woman good little woman : she got coal-black curly hair
Now every time she smiles Lord : kindness everywhere
I got a woman good little woman : she ain't a thing but a *courtesy*
*Takes a* little redheaded woman : and I'll keep you company
Treat me like ??? little baby : want you turn me around and around
Babe when you love me : good Lord take me around and around
Now these blues blues ain't nothing : Lord but a doggone hungry feel
Got no money in your pocket : to get a decent meal
And I went went to the depot : Lord I read up on the board
Babe if you see me catch you there :
Now I got to send send down soon : for my old-time used-to-be
Lord I felt so hard : till the blues crept up on me

Hand me down my suitcase : *reach* my walking cane
*Know* my mother *treat me* : catch that morning train
Well I thought I'd write : but I believe I'll telephone

Now if you catch me stealing : please don't tell on me
Because I'm stealing : to my doggone used-to-be
I woke up this morning : had the blues all around my bed
I couldn't help but to think : about what my good gal said
Now I got a heart full of trouble : and a suitcase full of blues
I never seen no trouble : babe till I *stopped* with you
I'm going to leave here walking Lord : and talking to myself
I'm going to take my baby : or carry somebody else
It's hard it's hard : it's hard *to get out of this* town
*Get* another ??? :

Woke up this morning : couldn't even walk in my shoes
My baby just quit me : she left me with the bust up blues
When you see two women : running hand in hand for long
Bet your B V Ds : something is going on wrong
Bought you a yo-yo dress : *full packed in*
Now that's the thanks you give me : you left me with those bust up blues

Have you woke up in the morning : *you weep and moan*
Your best girl quit you : left you all alone
Got a brownskin woman : just about as I need
And the reason I say so : she so sweet to me
When she rub my head : she make my fever rise
When she rub my ??? : she's improved my appetite
Now I had me a woman : didn't mean me no good
Now I got me another woman : best in the neighborhood

You scold me faro now : drove all from your door
Well the Good Book say : you got to reap just what you sow
There was ice and snow now : laying outside your door
Your good old man rolled for you : at times when he was not able to go
I can't sleep for dreaming now : I can't stay woke for crying
I was thinking about : that little old brown of mine
Now I'm worried now : but I won't be worried long
It takes a worried woman now : sing a worried song
Now you got a bad husband now : baby that'll be all right
Said I'll dodge your husband : like a rabbit dodge a dog at night
I'll be so glad : when my buddy dead and gone
Know my buddy got something now : Lord I'd like to own

I'm going to give my baby : no more cherry ball
Don't you let her get drunk Lord : and she'll *lower* her
She used to be mine : but look who's got her now
Well he sure can't keep her : she don't mean no good nohow
You see me coming now : put your man outdoors
You know I ain't no stranger baby : I been here before
Sun rose this morning : I was laying out on my floor
No sweet woman to love me : I didn't have no place to go
Said the sun going down now : black dark caught me here
Ain't got nobody to love me : nobody to feel my care

She wouldn't if she could : and she wouldn't do it at all
Grab another man : and went across the hall
Grabbed my gal : around the waist
Told me you better hurry : and you better make haste
Run around the house : took me a peep through the crack
See my baby : at a dirty act
Just as well : make it up in your mind
Ain't mush *chitlin* : but stir it in the house

Worked all the summer : and all the fall
Now I've got to take Christmas now : in my overalls
Going up the country : won't be back till fall
Times get no better : I won't be back at all
You treat me : like didn't know my name
You mistreated me now : for another man
My baby quit me : didn't say a word
Was on account : of something that she heard
When I had money : I had a friend
Ain't got no money : I ain't ain't got no friend
Take one more drink : make me tell it all
Somebody : stole my little all-in-all

Because Adam said to Eve : *you been cute so cute*
You wouldn't give me none : of that forbidden fruit
They had one is named Cabel : one is named Ain
You know by that : they must have shook that thing

Everybody here baby : seem to have a jolly time
Lord there nobody knows : what's on my troubled mind
Lord but I may be the youngest : Lord take my advice
And don't never let : the same woman quit you twice
Don't let your woman know you love her : you do you have done wrong
She'll *commence* ??? : pack up her clothes and gone
When you catch you a freight train baby : bounded for Santa Fe
That's when I done found out baby : this ain't no place for me
Because I did everything mama : tried to make you kind
Now seem everything everything you do : it is to worry my mind

Sometimes I wonder : I want to go back home
Because my baby : have left me all alone
The clothes look lonesome : hanging out on the line
You can tell by that : I've got rambling on my mind
And I said Lord : baby don't act that way
Baby when I leave you : I'm going away to stay
I said Lord : what you want me to do
I took all my money : and I brought it home to you

Lord it's early this morning : Lord about four o'clock
There was something in my bedroom : began to reel and rock
Lord have you ever been accused baby : [when you] ain't done nothing wrong
Lord that's a heart filled with squalor: Lord just sure as you born
Lord but you can't be [mine, my baby] : and someone else's too
There can no one get you baby : Lord until I get through
Oh you can always tell : when a when a woman loves a man
Lord she'll take bad treatment : and she'll do the best thing she can

Lord when I got up this morning : snow was on my windowpane
I couldn't even see my baby : couldn't even hear her name
Lord and my baby is leaving : crying won't make her stay
Lord if crying would do : now I'd cry myself away
Lord and my room looked so lonesome : since my baby been gone
Lord I ain't got nobody : that I can call my own
Baby but you didn't come to see me : mama when I had felt alone
*If it had been love with you* baby : I wouldn't have been dead and gone
And you a no-good woman : you don't mean a man no good
Lord and if I don't love you : I would not if I could

I long to hear that : old guitar rag
Whenever I hear it : I do that guitar drag
Play that thing : old guitar for me
Take me back : to my home in Tennessee

Now some folks say : that love is blind
But I'm one gal : who knows her mind
Now one hot papa : is enough
Because I don't believe : in that two-time stuff

Early one morning : just about four o'clock
When the old Titanic : begin to reel and rock
Smith took his glasses : and walked out to the front
And he spied the iceberg a-coming : oh Lord had to bump
Some was drinking : some was playing cards
Some was in the corner : praying to their God
Little children cried mama : mama what shall we do
Captain Smith said children : I'll take care of you
Titanic sinking : in the deep blue sea
And the band all playing : Nearer My God to Thee

If you want to hear : preacher curse
Take his bread sweet mama : and save him the crust
Preacher in the pulpit : Bible in his hand
Sister in the corner : crying there's my man
Preacher comes to your house : you ask him to rest his hat
Next thing he want to know : sister where your husband at
Come in here elder : and shut my door
Want you to preach [for me] the same text : you did night before
See that preacher : walking down the street
Fixing to meddle : with every sister he meets
Preacher preacher : you nice and kind
Better not catch you : at that house of mine

Jellyroll keep working : just about Sixteenth Street
Well they got a nut factory : where the women do meet
Got a nut factory : where they work so hard
Well it's all over the country : husbands ain't got no job
Saturday evening : when they draw their pay
Well they don't draw nothing : if husbands don't draw them away
Some draw checks babe : some draw nothing at all
When they don't draw nothing : their husbands bust them in the jaw
Down on Franklin Avenue : jellybeans standing to and fro
Well you hear one jellybean ask the other one : which way did the good girl go

Skin man's hollering : passing right by my door
Well he's hollering skin : everywhere he goes
Some begs a nickel : some some begs a dime
Some begs the jelly : to that teasing brown of mine
Well it's skins oh skins : skin skin skin skin
I'm going away old skin : but I'm coming back again
Let me tell you : what the skin mens'll do
Well they sell your wife skins : and take her away from you

Times ain't now : nothing like they used to be
And I'm tell you all the truth : ooh take it for me
I done seen better days : but I'm putting up with these
I could have a much better time : but these girls now is so hard to please
Because I was born in the country : she thinks I'm easy to rule
She tried to hitch me to a wagon : she want to drive me like a mule
You know I bought the groceries : and I paid the rent
She tried to make me wash her clothes : but I got good common sense
I said if you don't want me : why don't you tell me so
Because it ain't like a man : that ain't got nowhere to go
I'll give you sugar for sugar : let you get salt for salt
And if you can't get along with me : well it's you own fault
Now wanted me to love you : and you treated me mean
You might *give a thought* : on my nightly dream
Sometime I think : that you too sweet to die
Then another time I think : you ought to be buried alive

Now when I leave here : I'm going to catch that M and O
I'm going way down south : where I ain't never been before
Once I had a notion : Lord and I believe I will
I'm going to build me a mansion : out on Decatur Hill
Now it's all of you men : ought to be ashamed of yourself
Going around here swearing before God : you got a poor woman by yourself
I started to kill my woman : till she laid down across the bed
And she looked so ambitious : till I took back everything I said
And I asked her how about it : Lord and she said all right
But she never showed up : at the shack last night

Can't tell my future : and I can't tell my past
Lord it seems like every minute : sure going to be my last
Oh a minute seems like hours : and hour seems like days
And it seems like my woman : ought to stop her lowdown ways
Oh that woman I love now : she's five feet from the ground
And she's tailor-made : and ain't no hand-me-down
I say that I've got a woman : Lord and she lightning when she smiles
Five feet and four inches : and she's just good hugging size
I know you see that picture : now up on your mother's shelf
Well you know by that : I'm getting tired of sleeping by myself
And it's T for Texas now : and it's T for Tennessee
Lord bless that woman : that put that thing on me

I'm having so much trouble : with those tooth ache blues
It's got me floor-walking : and wearing out my shoes
I need a quick-filling dentist : because I'm mean and cross
At night I'm hot with fever : and I just roll and toss
When I went to my dentist : he put me in his chair
It's a long pointed sharp something : don't make me pull my hair
He shot a burning something : into my cavity
Cocaine or soothing liquid : to ease my pain for me

I told him : he was grinding into my roots too deep
Sure was a rough old dentist : he made me moan and weep
He kept right on *a-progging* : until I lost my head
Right now I can't remember : the many things he did
And when he lay me way back : my senses left me fast
Before I hardly knew it : he flooded me with gas
I woke up weak and dizzy : he told me that I would
But all my pain had left me : he really done me good

Three pickaninnies : eating sugar-cane
Each one turned to the other : and said
*Must have made it good* : chicken in a pot
*Butter like melting* : on the front
Like a lollipop : with sugar tip
Wild about : my baby's lips
Grandma baked grandpa : some jellyroll
Ate it : and *said oh oh* my soul
*Went to my gal* : *on a Saturday night*
*Dinner* : suits her appetite
The blackest berry : the sweetest juice
*Black hair* : *for my prejudice*

Martha's sitting : on up that fence
Yowling : like she didn't have no sense
Blackbird cheeping : in a tree
Said to the redbird : skeedle-um-skee
Aunt Louise : she bought blue goose cheese
When she start shaking : it's *long loose please*
White little June bug : big fat duck
Come on ducky : let us try our luck
Jenny Mae : brother Sam
If you want to be : a good-time man
The night I saw : little Mickey Mouse
Sashaying : all around the house

Say excuse me mama : I don't mean no harm
Just come here : to sing this little song
Say my brown's got a wrist watch : and I got a ring
Bought that jewel : just tapping that thing
I been down in Memphis : been down in New Orleans
The way we tap it : boys it's most *obscene*
Now I bought a brand new car : it really wouldn't quit
I gave it to my baby : like to had a fit
Now look here baby : always having *soup*
*Got no rest : over my dead loot*

I got a house : way up on the hill
I got potatoes : and *they want*
I've got a patch : sitting in the back
??? *potatoes* : and it's tight like that
People in the kitchen : trying to
I've got potatoes :
I don't need no wife : don't need no home
Hang my potatoes : in a little brown
Potatoes on the simmer : potatoes on the boil
I've got potatoes : boys it won't stop at all
??? good as ??? : ??? good as
I've got potatoes : Lord they ought to

Oh tell me baby : where did you stay last night
For you come in this morning : sun was shining bright
Oh the black cat told the white one : let's go across town and clown
And the white cat told the black one : you better set your black self down
Tell me baby : where did you get your sugar from
I haven't had no boodle-bum : since you been gone
Now it was old lady *Diana* : was sitting on the rock
Along flew a bumblebee : and raised a great big knot
Tell me bumblebee : when did you fly from home
Oh you ain't done no stinging : on the boodie-bum
You know the baby kitten jumped up : oh and began to wine
You know he didn't know the racket : but he had the same thing on his mind
Tell me baby sister : where did you get your sugar from
Oh you don't know the racket : you ought to go back home
Oh tell me mama : what's the matter now
You don't know how to boodle-bum-bum : I know you didn't do it nohow

I didn't *roll in here* : *till Lord sometime* last night
I had to *ask* ??? : ??? *today*
I think I'll ramble : *rambling* on my mind
I ain't got no right to leave : ain't got no right to change my mind
Oh did you dream lucky : and wake up cold in hand
And you want to see some good gal : ain't got no man
Sometime I think I will : then I think that I won't
Sometime I think that I love her : then I think that I don't
Some screaming high yellow : I scream black or brown
For high yellow may mistreat you : but black won't turn you down
Mama I got a notion : honey and I believe I will
Catch a long jumping Judy : go on across the hill

Now I woke up this morning mama : blues all around my bed
Thinking about the kinds words : that my mama had said
Now my mama's dead : so is my daddy too
That's the reason I tried to hard : to get along with you
Now where there ain't no loving : ain't no getting along
Because you'll have more trouble : honey than all the day is long
So many days : I stoled away and cried
Poor boy has been mistreated : now I can't be satisfied
Now I'm going to write a letter : mail it in the air
Because the March wind blows : it blows news everywhere
Because I'm going up the country : won't be very long
Good gal : you can count the days I'm gone
I often tell my honey : don't have to fight
The gal that gets you : has got to try to treat you right
I'm crazy about my Jane : tell the world that I am
Because I'm going : got to sing long-distance blues
Now you get way back : you get to ball the jack
You begin to fuss : and get your rider back
I want to see my Jane : tell the world that I do
Because I'm going I'm going : to sing long-distance blues

I woke up this morning : blues all around my bed
Thinking about that wire : that my brown had sent
Lord I'm poor boy here : long ways from home
Ain't got nowhere : not to lay my head
Cold frosty ground : was my bed last night
Thinking about the wire : that my baby had sent
But my mama told me : Sam come down fast
Whiskey and women : will bother your learning bad
Now my mama dead : so is my daddy too
*Should I caught the wire* : trying to get along with you
So many days : I stoled away and cried
Poor boy's in the streets : can't be satisfied
Going write a letter : mailed it in the air
*Mail it by the window : love yous* everywhere
Lord Lord : ain't going to moan no more

If you wants your man : keep him out of Birmingham
Because the red-hot mama : drives your dollar down
I thought I'd send her : *but I'd leave it* at home
*Oh she showed a lot of farmers : boys how to right from wrong*
If you want your brown : better stay aside
I said on that train : you gone off of my mind
My road seem rocky : so the people do say
But I'm a ??? driver : lucky to find my way
Hot mama : sit down on my knee
*I got to walk them down the city : how you got it up for me*
*I said being in Alabama : meanest place I know
Because I'm going up the country : mama how bad *I feel*

Lord that Harlem goat mama : sure was feeling fine
*I went ??? search light* : up and down that long line
Now she grabbed that stick : and she broke that Harlem's back
And she tied old Harlem : to the railroad track
Lord the fast mail train : honey was coach and nine
And that Harlem goat : she was serving time
Lord *he gave her a shirt : it was a shirt of pink*
He caught that red shirt mama : trying to flag a train
He said when I die : don't bury me at all
Just pickle my body : up in alcohol
Lord I love my goat : better than I love myself
I'm going to kill my goat : I'm going kill somebody else
Lord it was early in the morning : about the break of day
With my head on a pillow : where my goat Lord used to lay


Old Timbrook was a black horse : black as any crow
Had a white ring around his forepaw : white as any snow
Yes old Timbrook he come darting : like a bullet from a gun
And old Molly she come creeping : like a criminal to be hung
Johnny Walker Johnny Walker : Johnny Walker my dear son
Hold tight rein on Timbrook : so that horse can run
Oh the cuckoo was a fine bird : hollers when he fly
But he never hollers cuckoo : till the fourth day of July
Oh the race track it was dusty : and the wind was high
Well you couldn't see old Timbrook : as he come darting by
Oh the children they did holler : and the old folks squalled
But old Timbrook he beat Molly : to the hole in the wall
I love my race horse : likes to have my fun
Old Mrs went to the race track : and lost all her mon'

Told me late last fall : you never had no man at all
Well you got more men : than a two-ton truck can haul
Told me to my face : that a good man in my place

Told me it was early last spring : when the birds began to sing
Well it's the last chance : kid to be around here with me
I told you early last June : when the flowers began to bloom
You can't do no better : another good girl can take your room
Go and heist your window : let your curtain down
Well you can't tell : there may be some joker around
Go and put on your nightgown : baby let's we go lie down
Well it's the last chance : shaking in bed with you

Well a short-legged mama : trying to carry your daddy by
Said I want to let you know : I growed most too high
When you see your rider : out in the road
Said she's telling all her friends : that's a nineteen thirty Ford
Now she doing things : that you don't never know

Oh stop and listen : at the *one-note* how she blow
Said you sell anyone parts : make the motor go
Walk with my good girl in the daytime : walk with her at night
Said I taught my kitchen *teller* : how to treat a good man right
Way you doing me mama : says its out of sight
Said anything a kid-man do : well it bes all right
I'm going to *jack* me a picket : from my yard back fence
I'm going to start a-whooping : learn the good girl some sense
Well I do and I do : do and I do love you
Said *nothing funny* : in a state about you

A lot of these women: too lazy to put up with none of good man's dirt
But they ain't too lazy : to count his money Saturday night
I know a lazy woman : put ten dollars in a telephone
Just to tell her sweet man : her monkey-man is out and gone
When a woman's too lazy : to try and bake an apple pie
She's too lazy to live : and she's too darn lazy to die
I know you lazy women are going to *pan me* : when you hear this song
But the truth *is* ??? : and I surely have to carry it on

Lonesome lovesick blues will make you feel so lonely : when you're left all alone
Dying for some loving : and the one you love has gone
Deep down in my heart : I'm feeling blue
Lonesome and lovesick : baby just for you
When I'm alone : I moan the whole night through
I want some loving : no one but you will do
My heart is aching : breaking for some news
My heart is aching : gee I'm all confused

I said dices oh dices : please don't you three on me
I'm just as broke and hungry : as any gambler can be
My buddy played the jack : when he give me that hard-luck queen
He was one of the luckiest at cards : that a gambler have ever seen
Jack of diamonds jack of diamonds : will turn your money green
It's the luckiest card : that a gambler have ever seen
I went to gamble in Cuba : I went to gamble in Spain
Say my woman told me last night : she did not want no gambling man
I said run here baby : sit on your daddy's knee
Say I just want to show you honey : just what gambling have done for me

Get me a shotgun : and use it in the woods
I would fix you this way : that you wouldn't do no man no good
Started to kill her : and she fell down on my bed
Before *ten* this morning : you had me talking out my head
Don't the moon look pretty : shining down from that willow tree
I can see my baby : and she can't see me
Some of these menfolks : look just like my sure-to-be
If you mistreat my woman : I'm going to make you jump in the deep blue sea
Say run here woman : and see what you done done
You done started me to loving you : and now your other man done come

Well I'm going to Detroit : get myself a job
I'm tired of laying around here : working on the starvation farm
Yeah I'm going down there and get me a job : working in Mr Ford's place
Say that woman told me last night : that you cannot even stand Mr Ford's ways
Say I got me a little [low, bitty] woman : five [foot, feet] from the ground
She five foot standing : and she four feet lying down
Say I know my dog : baby if I hear him bark
And I know my woman : if I feel her in the dark
Say you better stop your woman : from smiling in my face
Woman if you keep on a-smiling : I'm sure going to take your place

One of these mornings : it won't be long
You going to look for me baby : and I will be gone
Lord I'm going to leave here walking : Lord I'm going away
But I may be back to see you : one cold rainy day
She tried to make me think : she is true to me
But she just as crooked : as she can be
I spent her money : she spent mine
She used to spend my dollars : just like she spent my dimes
That's all right : *bad luck pass on*
I'd love to go home any time : and catch another mule in my stall
I don't want no woman : that wears a number nine
I wake up in the morning : I can't tell her shoes from mine

Every night : I wander all by myself
Thinking about the woman I love : loving someone else
Boo hoo : I just can't keep from crying
I'm worried about my baby : she's on my mind
Sometimes I wonder : do she think of me
And again I wonder : if I will ever be free
I'm telling all you women : what's on my mind
I never loved one woman : no more at a time
Boo hoo : I wring my hands and cry
I'm thinking about the loving : that I let go by
Since you been gone baby : I haven't been a bit of good
Because I never get the loving : that I really should

My baby ain't good-looking : and she don't dress fine
But she gives me money : all of the time
She goes out at night : just like she's on wheels
And then I know : she's going out to rob and steal
I lay in my bed : my baby brings me my meals
What good is a woman : if she don't rob and steal
I used to live with a woman : they called her *Tilty Til*
I soon got rid of her : she couldn't rob and steal
I know : how you hungry hustlers feel
Your woman don't know how to rob : she is too doggone scared to steal

Been a poor boy : a long way from home

??? : no money to bear my fine

Lord I guess : I'll have to catch that *Frisco out*

And if that don't do : I'm going to try the woods awhile

I cried hello Central : give me your long-distance phone

I cried please ma'am : give me thirteen forty-nine

Well I'm going downtown baby : won't be gone so long
Say I'm tired and worried : about to sing this song
And I stay at home baby : you don't treat me right
The best time I have girl : when you's out of my sight
Said give me back the wig I bought you : let your head go bald
But when I first met you babe : you didn't have no hair at all

I went downtown : didn't mean no harm
Police grabbed me : right by my arm
Soon I began to kick : I began to rear
They like to throw *me* : in the air
Now ??? : was in the stand
Had them law books : in his hand
*Evil Bridges* : and Moses Brown
Am going across the street ??? : going to town

I said hey mama : I'll give you your last chance
You do the world a service : but you want to wear my pants
I said hey : what's the matter now
You just a trifling woman : don't mean me no good nohow
I give you my money : but that don't do no good
I begun ??? *to worry* : that's just what I should

Nobody knows old Naptown : baby like I do
If you will stop and listen : I will tell you a thing or two
When you get lonesome : and want to have some fun
You just grab a train : and try old Naptown some
When you get to Naptown : the blues won't last very long
Because they have their pleasure : and they sure do carry on
I would rather be in Naptown : than any place I know
I can get me a ticket : and stop by the *Walter* show
I'm going back to Naptown : baby don't you want to go
Because there ain't nobody : knows old Naptown like I know

Woke up my baby : come my love
Unlock the door : the sky's above
Are leaking : on your bed
Papa's in the rain : getting all wet
Getting all wet : getting all wet
And if I die : you will regret
Papa had : no place to go
You got a nice warm room : and so
Share it with papa : don't forget
Papa's in the rain : getting all wet
This rain ain't healthy : I've been told
Hear me cough : catching cold
Ain't no telling : what I'll get
Papa's in the rain : getting all wet
Papa's got : no coat at all
You got a raincoat : in your hall
This suit I told you : was too small
You nappy head : you knew it all
It lets me stand : but I can't sit
Papa's in the rain : getting all wet
Papa must eat : or he will die
You got pork chops: you got pie
Graveyard : is such a lonely place
Don't want dirt : thrown in my face
Pity old papa : and don't forget
Papa's in the rain : getting all wet

Mama's baking cookies : out in the kitchen
Papa smells the cookies : and his nose starts to itching
Papa tried to steal one : like he did before
But mama's got the lock : on the kitchen door
Papa says to mama : come a little closer
Mama looks at papa : says oh oh no sir
Papa turns around : starts to go away
Comes right back : when she hear him say
Papa says to mama : you a real nice-looker
You turn on the heat : like a fireless cooker
Come a little closer : in your papa's arms
Another little kiss : wouldn't do us any harm
Papa comes home : when his work is over
Mama says to papa : you sure ain't clover
Guess what I cooked : for you today
Mama just smiles : when she hear papa say

Went to the station : to get me a train
Going to climb on board : and ride again
Just climb aboard : and ride around
I might get off : at Memphis town
Shovel in the coal : see the wheels go around
Everybody's going : down to Memphis town
I said conductor : where the trains all going
I want to go see : that gal of mine
He answered me : with a railroad frown
All trains going : to Memphis town
I said what's doing : down old Memphis way
The trains all going : there today
The trainman said : there's a jubilee
And Memphis is town : that's only place for me
I said to the station man : where's my train
He said I never knowed : you own the train
I said you better answer : or I'll smack you down
He said all trains going : to Memphis town
Goodbye folks : I'm on my way
See you : on some other day
Got my ticket : here's my train
Going down to Memphis : see my gal again

I'd rather be sloppy drunk : than anything I know
And another half a pint : mama will see me go
I love my moonshine whiskey : better than a filly loves her mare
You can take your pretty bucks : give me my cool kind can
I'd rather be sloppy drunk : sitting in the can
Than to be out in the streets : running from the man
Mmm : bring me another two-bit pint
Because I got my habits on : and I'm going to wreck this joint
My gal trying quit me : for somebody else
Now I'm sloppy drunk mama : sleeping all by myself

I'm a 'fore-day rider mama : riding all night long
Anywhere I come mama : I sing my worried song
Now I'm going to leave you mama : we can't get along
Going to let you go mama : and sing my worried song
I won't carry nobody mama : I'm riding by myself
Because the 'fore-day blues : don't worry nobody else
And I rode to make you happy baby : rode all night and day
You brought me these blues mama : seems like they're going to stay

Did you ever go down : on the Mobile and K C line
I just want to ask you : did you ever see that girl of mine
I rode the Central : and I hustled the L and N
The Alabama women : they live like section men
Don't cry baby : your papa will be home some day
I've been away baby : but I did not go to stay
Don't the clouds look lonesome : across the deep blue sea
Don't my gal look good : when she's coming after me

I ain't going to be : your lowdown dog no more
You don't want me baby : down the road I'll go
Now I work hard mama : and I brought you home my pay
You say you ain't going to miss me : when I'm gone away
Ooo : ooo wee
It's a lowdown shame : the way you treat poor me
My home ain't here : I ain't compelled to stay
It's your time now : but it'll be mine some sweet day
And I ain't going to be : your lowdown dog no more
The train is at the station : my mind's made up to go

I'm going to the country : put my watch in pawn
I don't want it to tell me : that you've been gone
I had some tough luck lately : I got locked up in jail
I sat and called you baby : to come and go my bail
I'm going down to Georgia : then up to Tennessee
So look me over baby : this is the last you'll see of me
The last time I tried to love you : you were so very cold
I thought that I was standing : holding the North Pole
I can look and see the greenback : growing on that hill
But I ain't seen the greenback : on a dollar bill
I haven't any money : for a ticket on the train
But I will ride the rods baby : to be with you again

I come to your house : and knock upon your door
You had the nerve to tell me : you didn't want me no more
After all I've done : what more can I do
I gave you my love : and tried to get along with you
I fed you when you were hungry : took you in when you was outdoors
I give you my money : and even bought your clothes
I tried to treat you right : you would not pay that no mind
There ain't no more I can do : there ain't no needs in trying
I know you won't miss me : after I am gone
But always remember : that you treated your daddy wrong
Now I'm going to leave you : and do the best I can
Because you don't want me : there must be some other man

I saw your mama : in Kansas City
The way she was looking : was a doggone pity
Feet on the ground : clothes wasn't clean
Dirtiest old stuff : I ever seen
Now I got a gal : she is big as a bull
She never stops drinking : till her belly gets full
Gets full of liquor : and tries to sing
Tight like that : and shake that thing
I ask her about it : she said before long
Let's get together : because your water's on
Let's get started : be long gone
Let's get together : what you waiting on
I saw you mama : way last spring
Eyeballs shining : like a diamond ring
Staggered down the street : hollering and a-fussing
I tried to stop her : and I got a good cussing
I saw your mama : your papa too
What they was doing : just won't do
I slipped up on them : and took one look
What they was doing : wasn't in the book
If you want some loving : you want it cheap
Go down on Ellsworth : about the middle of the week
Show them girls a quarter : they won't let you go
It's four or five times : and then some more

About four this morning : blues come in my door
Please Mr blues : don't come here no more
I keep the blues all night : and the whole day through
I'm so full of blues : I don't know what to do
Well something has got to be done : to get these blues off my mind
I believe I'll get drunk : and stay drunk all the time
Well I'm going to leave you : I ain't going to sing no more
Because I'm full of blue : and I have got to go

In the wee midnight hours : long before the break of day
When the blues creep up on you : and carry your mind away
While I lay in my bed : and cannot go to sleep
While my heart's in trouble : and my mind is thinking deep
My mind was running : back to days of long ago
And the one I love : I don't see her anymore
Blues why do you worry me : why do you stay so long
You come to me yesterday : been with me all night long
I've been so worried : I didn't know what to do
So I guess that's why : I've had these midnight hour blues

You're a mean mistreating mama : and you don't mean me no good
And I don't blame you baby : I'd be the same way if I could
You say you're going to leave me : well you say you going away
That's all right baby : maybe you'll come back home some day
Now you're a mean mistreater : and you mistreats me all the time
Now I tried to love you : swear but you won't pay that no mind
Can you remember mama : in the morning I knocked upon your door
You had the nerve to tell me : that you didn't want me no more
Ain't it lonesome : sleeping all by yourself
When the one that you love : is loving someone else

Hurry down sunshine : see what tomorrow brings
May bring drops of sorrow : and it may bring drops of rain
Now I love my baby : but [she, my baby] don't love me
When I get in trouble : she is the last one that I see
Going down on the bottom : back to the Lone Star State
Stand back pretty mama : I don't want you to make me wait
So long people and sweethearts : I'll soon be on my way
Now I'm leaving this lonesome old town : now I may come back some day
Now I never got worried : until the fireman rang his bell
Two keen long whistles : bid me long farewell

Now I love my good corn liquor : and I really mean I do
Now I don't care who knows it : and I really mean that too
Now I've been drinking my good corn liquor : I mean don't no one get rough
Now I try to treat everybody right : but I mean don't start no stuff
Give me another half a pint : [and, then] maybe I'll go home
The reason why I'm getting drunk today : I swear my baby's gone
Some folks like their alcohol : but give me my corn *I believe* all the time
Reason why I love it so well : it's so soothing to my mind
So give me some more corn liquor : if I get drunk [just please, please just] take me home
I ain't going to bother nobody : just let the good times baby roll on

Nights so lonesome : and the days so long
Ain't had no loving : since you been gone
If you see my baby : tell her to hurry home
Ain't had no mmm : since she has been gone
You put the puppies on my mama : you drove me crazy too
You done made me love you : what can I do
Won't you tell my baby : to hurry back to me
She's got the best old mmm : I ever did see
Won't you tell my baby : to hurry back to me
She got the best old loving : that I ever did see
You can pull your dress babe : up above your knees
You can strut your stuff babe : but don't mess with me
You going to leave me you going to leave me : you going to leave me blue
I want some of your loving : don't care what you do

Now I've got a girl : she lives down in in Shady Lane
I love that girl : but I'm scared to call her name
It's going to be one of these mornings : swear and it won't be long
I'm going to catch the first thing smoking : and down the road I'm going
Where I long ain't here baby : it's way out in the west
In the Smoky Mountains : where the eagle builds his nest
Did you ever love a girl : a girl you hate to lose
Don't lose your temper : when you've been drinking booze

I had the blues before sunrise : with tears standing in my eyes
It's such a miserable feeling : a feeling I do despise
Seems like everybody : everybody's down on me
I'm going to cast my troubles : down in the deep blue sea
Today have been : such a long old lonesome day
I've been sitting here thinking : with my mind a million miles away
Blues starts a-rolling : and it stops at my front door
I'm going to change my way of living : ain't going to worry no more
Now I love my baby : but my baby won't behave
I'm going to buy me a hard-shooting pistol : and put her in her grave

Believe I'll take me a walk : around the corner by myself
And if I can't find my baby : I don't want nobody else
She went out last night : and she didn't even say goodbye
How come she left me : Lord I really don't know why
Now I'm going out this morning : my forty-five in my hand
Now I'm going to kill my woman : for loving another man
Then I'm going to the judge : and I'm going to fall down on my knees
Ask him please fair judge : have mercy on me please
Judge I done killed my woman : because she treated me so unkind
Treated me so unkind : till I swear I lost my mind
Well it's please please please : don't send me to the electric chair
Just give me my time : and I'll try to do it anywhere
When I'm dead and gone : and six feet in the ground
You can only say : there's a good man has gone down
Oh it looks mighty cloudy : and I believe it's going to rain
I just love to hear : my baby call my name

Now I woke up this morning : my woman was standing over me
She had a big forty-five : and she was mad as she could be
Now I prayed to my baby : and to the Lord above
Now I said honey please don't shoot me : baby you the only woman I love
She seen me with a woman : standing at her front gate
Now I tried my best to dodge her : but I was just a little too late
Now and it's please please please darling : honey please don't take my life
Because you got me all wrong baby : honey that was another man's wife

No need to ask me : why I'm packing my clothes
I'm going to leave you mama : and I really don't care who knows
Now I used to love you : but now I'm getting tired of your kind
I'm going down south : just to see what I can find
Now I may miss you : but I don't think I will
I'm going to get me a new woman : to love me till I get my fill
You mistreated me mama : you would not treat me nice and sweet
So I'm going down south : shake this dust of this town off my feet

My woman so lowdown : she barrelhouse all the time
She's low and squatty : but I love that girl of mine
When she gets up in the morning : she starts to drink her corn
Every time I think of that woman : I wished I had never been born
She struts around all day : she barrelhouses the whole night through
But when she loves me : I forget that I ever was blue
I wish that I could cure : her barrelhousing ways
And is I stay with her : I'll barrelhouse some day myself
Now I love my woman : swear that she won't act right
Gets her head full of whiskey : and wants to start a fight

Well this barrelhouse woman : what makes you so mean
Well you the meanest old woman : baby that I ever seen
You stay drunk all night : and the whole day long
Sometimes I begin to wonder : what in the world is going on wrong
Now I've told you once : ain't going to tell you no more
Now the next time you get drunk : right out my door you'll go
Now I'm going to get real mean baby : I swear I won't act right
Next time I catch you drunk : baby we going to have a fight
I don't want no barrelhouse woman : messing around with me
If you got to get drunk baby : mama please just let me be

Now I believe : I believe I'll go back home
Because this life I'm living : won't let me stay here long
His wife is gone : but she was all right with me
He would give her ninety-four dollars : and she would give me ninety-three
I believe : I believe I'll make a change
Going to turn off this gas stove : I'm bound for a brand new range

Come on boy : let's go down on Tenth Street
Some of the prettiest women down there : that you ever did meet
Now down on Smith Street : where you get your rocking rye
Boy that's what I'm talking about : and I ain't talking no lie
Now I'm got a gal : she's so sweet
Sweetest little gal : that I ever did meet
Every time I see my woman : walking down the street
Boy great big legs : and that little bitty feet
Now give me whiskey : you can give him gin
I'm going away baby : but I'll be back again
Now down on Tenth Street : boy it's a terrible mess
Boy we can have more fun down there : than any place I guess
Now I like my bucketful of beer : and I like my gin
Boy I ain't coming back here no more : with a *very win*
You hear me talking to you : you hear me talking fast
Boy you liable to slip up : and fall on your yas yas yas

Big Four blowed this morning : at the break of day
And it sounds so lonesome : because it taken my baby away
Big Four Big Four : won't you please turn your train around
Because here I sit all down and out : with my head hung down
I tried to be as good to that woman : as one man could be
And I mean it's a shame : the way she went and left poor me
Yes I'm down and out : ain't got no money to ride no train
But I'm going to find my good gal : and bring her back home again
Please Mr brakeman : won't you let a poor man ride your blinds
I'm just trying to make it : back to that gal who is worrying my mind

I'm a hard-hearted papa : there's nothing pleases me
I've had to be good long enough : now I'm going to be mean as I can be
I don't even like what I drink : my food don't taste right at all
And a lowdown no-good woman : is the cause of it all
When I tried to be soft and easy : people would not let me be
Now I'm just as mean and hateful : swear as I can be
I spent all of my money : showing my friends a great big time
Now they laugh and grin at me : because I ain't got a lousy dime
So I'm a hard-hearted papa : I've done changed my ways
And I think they will stay changed : for the rest of my days

You left me crying baby : please come back to me
And you know I've done all baby : I've been as good as I could be
Why did you go : and leave me cold in hand
I know what it's all about : it was on account of your other man
Now I can't sleep at night : there's rocks all in my bed
Because I ain't got you pretty mama : to hold my aching head
I'm going to buy me a shiny pistol : I'm coming after you
I ain't going to let you : treat me just like you do
So watch your step mama : you know what you've done
If you don't come back to me : hot spring water won't help you none

Minutes seem like hours : and hours seem like years
Since I've had these blues : I just can't keep from shedding tears
I'm going to tell everybody : what my good gal done to me one day
She put me out and broke my heart : just to pass the time away
Now I ain't got no money : and I ain't got nowhere to stay
But that's all right baby : if you want to turn me away
You know I work hard baby : and I brung you home my check
Now I ain't never loved no woman : like I loved you yet

You evil-hearted woman : you got a heart like a stone
You don't mean me no good : so I leave you alone
You used to be sweet : but you ain't sweet no more
You want to leave me alone : and stay away from my door
You're just like a rattler : you always ready to bite
So I'm going to get me a good woman : who will treat me right
Yes you're evil : just as evil as you can be
I don't want you to cook for me no more : because you might poison me
So be on your way evil-hearted woman : and stay away from my door
I done took your foolishness long enough : and I don't want you no more

Women if you got a good man : give him three good meals every day
If you don't : some other woman is going to tow your man away
I've got so many women : that I don't care when one dies
I don't even weep : I don't even cry
Some men crave high yellow : but give me black or brown
Because I can't tell the difference : when the sun goes down
Blacker the berry : sweeter is the juice
I got a good black woman : and I ain't going to turn her loose
They say black is evil : and they don't mean you no good
But I would not quit my black woman : baby if I could
I've got a good black gal : I've got a good black gal
She's my buddy : and I swear she is my pal

Whiskey is my habit : good women is all I crave
And I don't believe in two things : will carry me to my grave
I'm going to Louisiana : where I can drink and have my fun
I can't stay here much longer : because my time has just about come
When you see me leaving baby : don't you wear no black
You see your loving daddy : walking down some lonesome railroad track
When I was a hustler : I'm in my prime
I would drink good whiskey : and gamble all the time

She ain't good-looking : but the good gal do go clean
And I'm crazy about my baby : though she is so mean
My gal got arrested : and they put her in the county jail
They fined her eleven twenty-nine : and they even allowed her no bail
Now I'm going to see that judge : and talk to him myself
Tell him that he sent my gal to the county road : and left me by myself
Now I never felt so sorry : till the people walked down the lane
And my heart struck sorrow : when they called my good gal's name
And I heard the jailor say hello : prisoners all fall in line
I'm also talking about that long-chain woman : that got eleven twenty-nine
I've got the blues so bad : that I just can't rest
I'm going to ask that jailor : can I do my good gal's time myself

Now you got me grieving mama : over nobody else but you
Yes you got me grieving mama : I really mean that's true
I'm not going to worry : in my life no more
If you want to leave me : you can go
Now you got me grieving mama : over nobody else but you
Yes you got me grieving mama : I love no one else but you
I woke up this morning : didn't find you there
Wondering what man : had his hand running down through your hair down there
But I'm not going to cry : I'm not going to sigh
You going to leave me : bye bye bye

She's got a bed in her bedroom : it shines like a morning star
When it starts to rocking : it looks just like a Cadillac car
Baby baby baby : you had better get your back yard cleaned
Because you *better* cook the best old corn bread : a poor man ever seen
Get your red ripe tomato : and your T-bone steak
And if you fix it like I like it : I will get you a new V-Eight
I like it early in the morning : I've got to have it late at night
I don't want you to fix it : if you don't fix it right
I smell your cabbage burning : baby turn your good bread around
Because in your kitchen baby : it's where the good stuff can be found

Times is done got so tight : so I'm going to rob and steal
It's done got so tight : a man can't get a decent meal
I ain't got no shoes : and I ain't got no clothes
The house rent man : has done put my things outdoors
It was thundering out and lightning : oh Lord how it did rain
But somehow : I'm going to get even with that house rent man
I've done got evil : and I've done got mean
And when I start to stealing : I'm going to pick the rounders clean

I'm longing for my sugar : and I don't want no one else
And I don't miss her so much : until I'm all by myself
Now I knowed when I quit her : I was doing wrong
Now I've got trouble on my mind : it's trying to get her back home
I'm going to pay the boss : and get my check-card today
And give it to my sugar : if she'll come back home to stay
Fussing and fighting : ain't no way to get along
This done caused me a world of trouble : and broke up my happy home
I can't work in the daytime : I can't sleep a wink at night
Thinking the woman that I love : ain't been treated right

I'm going to get me a brand new [shiny] pistol : with a long shiny barrel
I'm going to ramble this town over : until I find my girl
I'm going to go to the station : and try to find her there
And if the Lord has not got her : she's in this world somewhere
She left me with a head full of trouble : and a head full of misery
And now she's got me crying : baby please come back home to me
My mother told me : don't you weep don't you moan
Because son there'll be women here : when you dead and gone
When I get through rambling : and looking this whole world through
I won't be dead with trouble : you know I died to *lose*

Now I'm down and out : ain't got no friends around
I'm going from door to door : everybody turns me down
Now my woman treats me : [just] like I'm a motherless child
She's always squabbling : she don't give me a ??? smile*
Now here I am people : out in the ice and snow
My clothes all in pawn : ain't got nowhere to go
She said she liked my music : but my tune's too short
But if she gets long winded player : she's sure to get caught
Now babe I can't help it : if I can't play long
I'm just a little skinny fellow : and a player is strong

If somebody finds me : when I'm dead and gone
Say I did self-murder : I died with my boots on
Took me a Smith and Wesson : and blew out my brains
I didn't take no poison : I couldn't stand the strain
No I ain't no coward : and I'll tell you why
I was just tired of living : but wasn't afraid to die
Take me to the graveyard : put me in the ground
Please write on my tombstone : my woman threw me down
In my farewell letter : someone's sure to find
Goodbye old cruel world : I'm glad I left you behind

Rising river blues : running by my door
They running sweet mama : like they have not run before
I got to move in the alley : I ain't allowed on your street
These rising river blues : sure have got me beat
Come here sweet mama : let me speak my mind
*If you need to talk* : take a long long time

Jellyroll jellyroll : you can eat it on the fence
If you don't go get it : you ain't got no sense
Talking about my jelly : about my sweet jellyroll
When you take my jelly : mama can't keep you at home
Can make a blind man see : a lame man walk
It make a deaf woman hear : and a little baby talk
Now tell all you people : what jellyroll done done
Made grandma : marry her youngest grandson
Jellyroll is a thing : a man won't do without
He'll ??? *things* ??? : if the people *put him out*
I went up on the mountain : looked down in the sea
A good-looking woman : winked her eye at me
If you don't believe : my jellyroll will do
You can ask anybody : on Auburn Avenue

You know I use plenty grease : every day
But I ain't did no frying : while you was away
My frying pan was on the stove : getting hot
I said sweet papa : put some grease in my pot

I mistreated you baby : and I know I was wrong
I gave you all my love : still you were unsatisfied
But my love for you baby : is all gone and died
??? baby : you can't have this town
I'm leaving here baby : *feel no urge of backing down*
When I call you babe : you refuse to come
Hot spring waters : they won't help you none
Some day baby : when I'm dead and gone
You're going to hear : this old lonesome song

I am an old bumblebee : a stinger just as long as my arm
I stings every good-looking woman now : everywhere I goes along
Says as I fly around now : I makes a beautiful song
And everywhere I sting a good-looking woman : says I'll sure find me a home
Now I'm an old bumblebee : just dropped in your town

And they all crying old bumblebee : you know it hurts so good

And the preacher's in the pulpit : jumping up and down
And the sisters back in the amen corner : their southern bound

Baby I got the whiskey : and you got the gin
Let's both baby drink : and get drunk again
Hey whiskey : uh what you say gin
Let's both baby drink : and get drunk again
It don't make me no difference : how drunk you may be
Since you don't hold back baby : honey in loving me
Hey I got the washboard : and you got the tub
Let's put them together : baby and we'll rub-a-dub-dub
Hey washboard : what you say tub
Let's put them together : baby and we'll rub-a-dub-dub
It don't make me no difference : how tired you may be
Since you don't hold back baby : honey in rubbing with me

Baby I say you going to need : my little help some old lonesome day
But it will be too late sweet baby : your daddy will be gone away
But I mean that's all right now baby : honey now that's all right for you
You got me here in all this lowdown trouble : baby and this lowdown way that you do

Go back old devil : and look up on your shelf
And get you soap and water : and bathe your dirty self
I beat my baby : man with a rope and a line
Some lowdown scoundrel : been fishing in my pond
Catching all my game fish : and grinding up their bones
What you want with a woman : man and she can't rob and steal
You don't need no man baby : don't know you in the dark when he feel

I says he's a country man : but that fool done moved to town
He really done sold his cotton : and now he's walking around
He's got the women : all calling him their old sugar pie
But now that country fool is broke : and they calling him the old country guy
He really wore a hole : in the bottom of his last pair of shoes
And his pants behind is hollering : I got those raggedy-holey blues
He's got to rob and steal : don't he got to leave out of this man's town
Know he'll say going back to the country : going to sow some more cotton seed down

Baby I'll split your kindling : you know I'll bellow your fire
I will pack your water : from the boggy bayou
Hey now tell me sweet baby : who may your manager be
Before many more questions : won't you please make arrangements for me
Your hair so doggone curly : and your eyes ain't blue
That's why sweet baby : I'm making a fool about you
Says I ain't good-looking : baby I don't dress fine
When you come to loving : I'll pacify your mind
Here's another little thing baby : want you to bear in mind
When I get my pay check: I give you my last dime
I wished I was like a little fish : in the deep blue sea
So a woman like you : could take a little fish at me

I taken my baby : to the candy stand
She got stuck : on the candy man
I taken my baby : to the candy stand
She got a fool : about the candy man
I taken my baby : to the peanut stand
She got a fool : about the old [nut, peanut] man
I taken my baby : to the banana stand
She got a fool : about the banana man
I taken my baby : to the whiskey stand
She fell on her face : about the whiskey man
I taken my baby : to the whiskey stand
She fell out : about the whiskey man
I taken my baby : to the money stand
She fell on her face : about the moneyman

Hey I wonder : where is that policy right man [at] now
I done lose all my money shooting craps : and I can't win no money nohow
I'm going to put my last dime : on the twenty thirty and the little old ten
Because they tell me that's my baby's initial : and it ought bring my money back home again
I'm going to play them straight across : man you know [I'm playing, I got] them straight down
Now policy man my number's done come out : bring me twenty-seven dollars on around
I'm going to put a four bit piece : back on the twenty thirty and the little old ten
And if them numbers come out man : it'll bring my money back right again
Policy man if my numbers come out : don't fool around on the street
Just cut across on St Lawrence Avenue : and bring my money on home to me

Now it don't make no difference sweet little old honey : a-how you trying to carry on
A-what you trying to do to me honey : I happen to have it in my bag
Now it don't make a bit of difference with me honey : things you trying to do to me
A-what you trying to do to me honey : I happen to have it in my bag
Now you may go honey you may go : you may stray all alone
But one of these days now little old sweet honey : you'll be out of house and home
Now you trying to do little dirty things honey : and keep it out of your daddy's sight
You fool right around now little old honey : and let me catch you dead to the right

I've had a funny feeling : all day and all night
Somehow here : I don't be treated just right
I ain't going to stay here today : if I have to walk
Ever since I been here : it's been the whole town's talk
I don't seem happy no more : I done got it bad
Thinking of the money : that I once have had
Now when you lose your money : don't lose your mind
If you lose your good girl : there's no use a-crying
I've had so much trouble : I've take it for my name
If you ever have trouble : man I want you to do the same
You will think : you left trouble all behind
Get well away from home : then it will roll across your mind

Made a date today : early or late
My baby got movements : like a old Cadillac Eight
I go away : I won't stay long
Thinking about that sweet thing : I've left at home
My baby loves me : tried to treat me right
Gives me her loving : both day and night
My baby says one thing : I know it is true
Can't have another man : and be good to you
Up in Chicago : long way from home
Wanted somebody else : carry my loving on
I'm going home : if I had a lock and key
To keep these men : from stealing my loving from me

Please baby please baby : won't you come back to your daddy one more time
You know baby you know baby : when I get my money will give you my last dime
When you left me babe : you left me feeling so blue
You know babe : I didn't love no one but you
I'm so blue baby I'm so blue baby : I can't sleep for drinking hardly talk for crying
You know baby you know baby : you are always forever on my mind
You know baby : I can't sleep at night
I go to take my meals : and can't eat a bite

I walked into a beer tavern : to give a girl a nice time
I had forty-five dollars when I entered : when I left I had one dime
Wasn't that a beer-drinking woman : don't you know man don't you know
She was a beer-drinking woman : I don't want to see her no more
When I spent down to my last dime : she said darling I know you're not through
I told her yes baby doll : and the diploma belongs to you
She'd often say excuse me a minute : I've got to step around here
And every time she'd come back : she'd say daddy buy me another quart of beer
I said got to step off baby : are there anything if she like
She said daddy I'll keep this table : if you promise me you'll be back
I said I'm sorry baby : but I only have one more dime
She said daddy buy me a small bottle of beer : so I can concentrate my mind

I got wise to you baby : after so many years
Once you had me worried : always shedding tears
But no : all over now
I just found out baby : you don't mean no good nohow
I tried to make things happy : so we could live a happy life
But darling after all I done : you wouldn't treat me right
People used to ask you was I your husband : you would gladly tell them no
Every time we'd get home : you said daddy I love you so
Now you want to come back baby : since you realized yourself
That I would treat you better : anybody else

My name is Memphis Slim : they call me the grinder man
If you be my customer : I'll let you have it on a easy plan
I do my ramming at midnight : and I don't be seen in the day
When everything is quiet and easy : Mr grinder can have his way
I got so many customers : it takes me a week to get around
But you need not be uneasy baby : Mr grinder won't let you down
If you want to see me baby : you better see me while you can
Because I'm a very busy fellow : you know they call me the grinder man

My room was empty : and my woman was gone
I didn't have a nickel : and all my clothes in pawn
I asked my next-door neighbor : which a-way did my baby go
She said she left for the border : down in old Mexico
I find a note on the floor : it almost send me off in a trance
She said it's nothing that you done : I'm just leaving in advance
It's so hard when a woman leave you : and she leave you on a *goon*
You come home feeling very happy : and find only a empty room

I've got something to tell you baby : don't let it break your heart
So long together : now we've got to part
Because I'm tired : of fattening frogs for snakes
After these long many years : believe I just see my great mistake
You told me that you loved me : say you love me all your life
I caught you around the corner : telling that same lie twice
Once I used to love you : I couldn't help myself
Found out : you given your love baby to somebody else
Now listen little girl : you don't worry my mind anymore
Found out you acting funny : I'm sure going to let you go

Now I love to sing : that good old Taylor blues
When we want a drink : I swear we just can't lose
Now you see [Mr Melrose, that man] : standing in the floor
He going to give us a little drink : just before he go

I believe I'll marry : I believe I'll settle down
Lord I'm tired of being a rambler : my last trip of running around
Lord I wonder : will she ever call my name
Now if she don't love me no more : peoples ain't that a crying shame
They tell me marriage is a sweet life : I believe I'll try it myself
Lord I wonder : will she ever think of me
I'm sitting with my head bended down : and tears falling on my knee

How he's got a gal : she's shaped like a hog
Her voice remind me : of an awful dog
Her hair look just like : a chinchilla coat
You get close up on her : she smells just like a goat
You know she's smelling : got B O all the time
And she thinks soap and water : is a doggone crime
Now her ears are so long : her nose so flat
Her head so big : she can't wear no hat
Now her dogs are swollen : and she got one eye
She looks like a wreck : that happened last July
She's a ugly : got B O all the time
And she thinks soap and water : is a doggone crime
Now she must have been : her mother's only child
She should be a gorilla : because she sure is wild
Got ways like a monkey : as sly as a fox
She should be in a chain-gang : breaking up rocks
Now she got legs like a needle : she ain't got no chin
She's a beautiful woman : for the shape she's in
Her feet look like swings : way out on a limb
That's why : her mother put her off on him
Because she's buggish : she's got B O all the time
And she thinks soap and water : is a doggone crime

Now you may be sweet little woman : as an apple on a tree
Don't want no woman : to *lay* up and depend on me
Now if I'm the Pullman porter girl : you got to be the maid
So when every Saturday comes : we both can get paid
Now when I go to bed little girl : and lay beside of you
Now if I shake the cover : please try to shake it too
Now there's no such thing : as man and wife nowadays
We'll just call partners : so you cannot get sold for slaves

Woman you been having your way : and you don't want to see me have mine
So there's no getting along : we're just two of the same old kind
I tried to make things happy : and your life I tried to let you enjoy
But you tell me you your mother's baby girl : do you realize I'm my mother's baby boy
Around home you was just a spoiled one : and what you said it had to be
But do you know that's the same old story : little girl really go for me
Since we are just two babies : darling why can't we agree
I'll talk baby-talk to you : if you'll talk baby-talk to me

Now once I lived a life : of a millionaire
I was spending plenty of money : and I didn't bit more care
I was taking my boy friend out : for a good time
Buying him champaign whiskey : and sometime wine
But somehow or other : Lord my money ran low
Well well and I couldn't find a friend : I declare nowhere I go
Now if I ever get hold : to a dollar again
People I'm going to squeeze on to it : until the eagle grins
Now you got to be *deep* born blind : and cannot see
Both legs cut off : above your knee
All this must happen : and then I must agree
And then I said maybe boy friend : you can borrow a dime from me
Now you must not have : a tooth in your head
Get a letter from home : some of your folks is dead
Bring me the Titanic : that sailed the sea

Everybody wants to know : how do Memphis slim get by
Well but it ain't but three in my family : that's me myself and I
Now my mother she told me : son just don't lead a doggone mule
She said son have good manners : learn to paddle your own canoe
Even my woman she asked me : daddy do you really love me
I said maybe some day baby : but now my love is just for three
She said daddy who is it please : with tears standing in her eye
I said baby at this particular time : it's just me myself and I

I've been out all day : drinking both whiskey and gin
Now if you catch me sober : please make me drunk again
I'm not drinking because I'm thirsty : neither because I'm blue
I've just got to stay drunk woman : to try to get along with you
Whiskey make me stagger and stumble : fall down and scar my chin
I know you ain't no good Mr whiskey : but I got to try you again
I'm drunk Monday Tuesday and Wednesday : Thursday Friday and Saturday too
I'm supposed to get drunk on a Sunday : as I have nothing else to do
Good whiskey good whiskey : is all in the world I crave
I'm going to drink good whiskey : the rest of my doggone days

I'm down now baby : I'll be up some day
And I won't have to put up : with your evil ways
But there's a day coming baby : you going to worry too
Lord and I won't have to put up : with the lowdown way you do
You know I done : woman all in this world I could
But I found out baby : you didn't mean no good
You know I loved you : babe you breaking my heart
It hurts me so bad : for us to part
Now I'm not going to worry : my sweet life no more
You been making your tip woman : I'm going to let you go
So bye bye babe : if you call it gone
I know it's going to worry me : but it won't last long

Here I am : head over heels in love again
Besides the woman was my mother : and that's where love begins
I used to be a playboy : I played out both night and day
But since I met Miss *Lamar* : she have made me change my ways
Oh yes woman : you've caught the old coon at last
But I just hope I'll be happy with my future : as I am with my present and past
Now I love the life I'm living : and I'm living the life I love
Woman I don't believe I could be any happier : if I were living in heaven above

Now lend me your love : baby please lend me your love
I know you hear me keep moaning : just like Noah's dove
You got a mortgage on my love : you know there really is no doubt
But some day I'm going to find another woman : is going to buy your love mortgage out

Down on Number Nine : where the M and M men go
Every day : to have a real good time
If you want some fun : and a real nice time
You better join the boys and girls : down on old Number Nine
Do that dance : they call the bedspring *pop*
You can shut your eyes : begin reel and rock
All you've got to do : is take your time
Drink good whiskey : gin and wine

You can go to the ocean : you can go to the deep blue sea
But you can't find nobody : going to treat you like poor me
You can spend my money : you can pawn my *sicking* clothes
Catch you stooping : I'm going to let your meat outdoors
Well the sun's going down : mama you know what you promised me
Midnight supper : and my 'fore-day tea
Leaving your town : mama and I sure don't want to go
But to keep down trouble : mama guess I better go

If you ever been down mama : you know just how I feel
Just like a broke down engine : ain't got no driving wheel
Easy mama : somebody knocking at my door
It may be my yellow woman : mama you sure don't know
I love you pretty mama : I tell the world I do
I'm going to love you mama : till my dreams come true
If you want me to love you mama : have to do like Jesse James
Go out on some railroad track : and rob your daddy a passenger train

I'm worried today mama : but I won't be worried long
I'm going to catch me a freight train : and I'm going to be long long gone
My woman got a bed mama : shine just like the morning star
When me and her get to laying in it : it ride like a Cadillac car
I'm going back south mama : way down in Tennessee
Know the woman I love : she sure was good to me
I cried last night mama : and I cried the night before
I ain't going to let you mistreat me mama : so I won't have to cry no more

It is up to you baby : do anything that you want to do
*So long as I can get ??? : get back out of you*
You ought to be grateful daddy :
You are three times seven : you know just what you want to do

I'm worried now : and I won't be worried long
If he don't come to see me : you can count the days I'm gone
Some sweet day : I say it's after a while
You having a good time now : but your troubles will be after a while
When I leave this town : don't pin black crepe on my door
I won't be dead baby : but I ain't coming back here no more
I want all of you women : to strictly understand
If you don't want no trouble : please don't you worry my man

I can't sleep for dreaming : and I can't stay awake for crying
Cried the man I love : said he's traveling on the line
If my man could holler : like the Bob Lee Junior blows
I would follow my daddy : most everywhere he goes
And I asked the conductor : to let me ride the blinds
He said buy you a ticket : you know this train ain't mine
Oh I hate the train : that carried my man away
But the same train carried him : going to bring him back some day

The train I ride : burn no coal at all
But the *doggone engine* : pull my *Texas haul*
I'm going away : to wear you off my mind
Keep me worried : bothered all the time
I hate to see : the evening sun go down
Make me feel : that I'm on my last go-round
My mama told me : papa told me too
Don't you let no woman : make a fatmouth out of you
I'm leaving here : crying won't make me stay
The more you cry : the further I'm going away

Train's down here : track's all out of line

Mistreat me baby : mistreat your only friend
Mistreat me baby : sure going to do it again
I'm going to the river : sit right on the ground
If the blues overtake me : jump overboard and drown
Going to buy a shotgun : long as I am tall
I'm going to shoot my baby : just to see her fall

Oh now it's loving : really really wor-worrying me
And that cruel-hearted loving : it's going to be the death of me
Prison : sure don't want to make it my home
I'm a good-hearted poor boy : just a long way from home
Tell me cruel-hearted mama : what's on your hard-hearted mind
Say you keep me in trouble : so worried and bothered all the time
And I love my little baby : tell you just how I know
I will work rob and steal for her : baby in the frosty snow
And it's blues : woke me for my telephone
I got a long-distance call from my baby : daddy I ain't coming back home
The two women I'm loving : they keep bothering my heart
That's one in Cincinnati : my Waco wife that broke my heart
Tell me cruel-hearted mama : what you want your daddy to do
I'd rather see you murder me : baby and to leave me too
And I'm going away : little baby crying it won't be long
Said take your Bible pretty mama : and read the days your daddy's gone

I got the Niagara Falls blues : pretty mama keeps a-worrying you
And those Niagara Falls blues pretty mama : going to be the death of you
I walked down my pantry : I walked back up my hall
I stuck my head over the transom : another mule was in my stall
I got the blues so bad : that it hurts my tongue to talk
I got the blues so bad : that it hurts my baby's feet to walk
Now it's run to your window : heist your shade up high
It's stick your head out the window : see the worried blues pass by
I looked down the lonesome road pretty mama : far as I could see
Another man had my wife : and I swear the Niagara blues had me
I got the blues in a bottle : got the rattlesnake in my hand
How can I live in this world babe : my baby with another man
Now it's run here sweet mama : I'm [about to, certainly going to] get you told
You ain't the onliest woman in Cincinnati : got such a loving jellyroll
And I woke up this morning : my pillow slip wringing wet
I looked around for my baby : daddy I can't use you yet

If you ever been down mama : you know just how [I, a prisoner] feel
I ain't got nobody on the outside : *to play in the field*
And I laid in prison : my face turned to the wall
Says a no-good crow-jane woman : was the cause of it all
And it's a many old day : I drop my weary head and cry
I did not have no blues : but little mama just wasn't satisfied
It's pull on your race horse : bet on your derby too
I ain't got nobody in this world : will do love me true
And I locked in the death cell : and drop my weary head and cried
I told the sing sing prison board : this ain't like being outside
And if if hadn't been for you little mama : I wouldn't not been here
I drinking wine and whiskey : mama and your home-brewed beer

When a man gets in trouble : every woman throws him down

I'm so worried : don't know what to do
I waked up this morning : mama feeling sad and blue
Because my woman had done quit me : didn't have nowhere to go

Hey hey : hey hey hey
When I'm in my good whiskey : this is the way I sing my blues

Says there's no more good water : because this pond is dry

I walked down to the river : then turned around and run

If the fishes in the water had my blues : they'd die

Got a head full of foolishness : my baby got a rambling mind

Hey pretty mama : tell me what have you done

I done told you mama : ain't going to tell you no more

Now the blues so worrisome mama : between midnight and day
Now the blues done caused my woman : hon' to run away

Lord I can't *let its* continue : don't care what I do

Mama told me : six long weeks ago
Son you save your money : just to buy your clothes
Buy your clothes : let these women go

Hey hey mama : what is going on wrong
Spend my woman's money : mama and she won't come
Can't rest contented : don't care where I go

You're a mean mama : whispering in your ear

I'm going to grind my coffee : two or three dollars a pound
Ain't a man in this town : can grind this coffee like mine
It done got so good : that it make you bite your tongue
I'm a coffee-grinding fool : now let me grind you some

Trouble worried trouble : I been having all my days

When a man gets in trouble : every woman throws him down

I woke up Lord this morning : *things are worrying on a-* poor me

Then I went upstairs : fell down across my bed
Now my baby has a-quit me : talked all out of my head

I've got the Rock Island blues : waiting for the Rock Island train
I took the Rock Island train : and take a Rock Island ride somewhere
I've got a free transportation : looking for the train to ride
I need to ride the Rock Island : *just riding to satisfy*
If you ever been down : you know just how I feel
I'm going away : *I come* to get on board
Leaving : hang crepe on your door
I've got the rickets and the rackets : and my baby's got the Mobile blues
I've got the Rock Island blues : and I don't know what to do
One thing about these women : I cannot understand
All wear short dresses : trying to fool a workingman
Baby if anyone should ask you : who composed this song
Just tell Lonnie Coleman : done been to your town and gone

Wild about my loving : *crazy deeds* I have my fun
And if you want me to love you : don't pretend you never done
I ain't rough : I don't bite
??? *womens* : don't you treat me right
Baby come right in : coming right at me
I can *catch those* ??? : ??? *at the Santa Fe*
You know I been out east : been out west
Hard to tell : which mamas love the best
*Turkey's for some* : ??? *France*
Where the men in Texas going : it seems just the same
Now there's two things about : I just can't understand
A *cawdy-cawdy* husband : ??? *scrubby* man
Well I'm going out the country : and I can't carry you
Nothing up the country : monkey-man can do

You can mistreat me here : but you can't when I go home
I got somebody there : will make you leave me alone
Walk on : walk on little girl walk on
Say you going to keep on walking : till you lose your happy home
And you know you didn't love me : you fell across my bed
Full of your moonshine whiskey : mama talking all out of you head
Say I walked around to my window : and I peeped right through my blinds
I seen another darky : trying to change my woman's mind

When I find a town : that will satisfy my mind
Tell you that's where I'll be : for a great long time
When I get to Atlanta : walk on Decatur Street
I'm going to shimmy-shee-wobble : with every fair brown I meet
I got a woman named Miss Hattie : she lives on Fourteenth Street
Oh the way that woman love me : I swear she can't be beat
I done spent all of my money : my bank account run low
My woman had the nerve to tell me : daddy aren't you spending slow
Says my mama's dead : and my daddy's in the mines
And I'm a motherless child : and I just can't keep from crying

When I was lying in jail : with my back turned to the wall
I could lay down and dream : I could hear my good gal squall
Lord she brought me coffee : and she brought me tea
Fell dead on the floor : with the jailhouse key
I'm going down to the courthouse : see the judge and the chief police
My good gal fell dead : now I sure can't see no peace
I'll tell you what I'll do : and I sure God ain't going to tell no lie
I believe I'll lay down : take morphine and die

Now my mama's dead : and my papa can't be found
I ain't got nobody : throw my arms around
Yonder comes the devil : going to set this town on fire
Now when the chance comes up : I'm going to bid this town goodbye
I got ways like the devil : slipping around your gate
So I can find me a good gal : or won't have to take no *hate*
Let me tell you mama : what you said last night
Lay down on my bedside : try to treat me right
Lord I'm going up the country : but crying won't make me stay
More you cry : the farer I'll ride away

Easy mama : don't fade away
I'm going : where the Drummond cross the Yellow Dog
Lord I'm freezing here : with *you a-fighting all around the hall*
And I felt so rotten : and I didn't want to ride no train
I want to ride the Yellow Dog : where way out in the
I sat deep in my saddle : and I don't *remember the name*
Sat deep in my saddle Lord : and I ??? *name*
Just as sure as the train : leaves the rounded curve

I never felt so worried : till I found the loving lady blues

I can't sleep for dreaming : I can't eat for crying
I lay down last night : with that gal all on my mind
I got nineteen bird dogs : got one floppy-eared hound
It just take those twenty : run my fair brown down
I got a good gal in town : but she don't treat me right
I feel like going to the cemetery : laying right down and die
Feel like going to the cemetery : laying right down and die
For I done got worried : with that gal of mine

I went down to the river : just thirty-one days and nights
I'm looking for my good gal : come back and treat me right
I ain't got me nobody : carry my troubles to
I tell you peoples : I don't know what to do
Just as sure as your train : Lord backs up in your yard
I'm going to see my baby : if I have to ride the rods
I went away last summer : got back in the fall
My mind had a-changed : I wouldn't have come back at all
You can press my jumper : iron my overalls
I'm going to the station : meet the Cannonball

She has the hesitating stockings : the hesitating shoes
*The rich and the poor* : got the hesitating blues
How long now : will I have to wait
Can I get you now : honey have to hesitate
I can learn ??? : not to ball the jack
I can beat anybody : getting the good gal back
And I got a gal : who loves to roll
??? : right by her door
Around the curve : and around the bend
Yonder comes : that engineer
*Rifle's* on the *stage* : my *coffee's* in the *cool*
My little gal's : from Illinois
I'm not so good-looking : got no curly hair
Have a woman : take me anywhere

When you get up in the morning : when the ding-dong rings
You make it to the station : see the same old thing
Ain't nothing on the table : but the pots and the pans
Say anything about it : have supper with the man
Yonder come the little Nora : how do you know
I know by the apron : and the dress she wear
??? on her shoulder : piece of paper in her hand
Looking for some sergeant : to release some man

I aim to take my gun : ??? in your face
Going to let some graveyard : be your resting place
You going to miss me when I'm gone : honey and it won't be long
When you think I'm going : I'm standing right here with your *wally* on
When I'm gone : don't you grieve after me
Don't you forget : how I went away

She's long and tall : and wears a diamond ring
But she can beat anybody : at doing that thing
You go through the *barrel* : and you ride like a *tiger*
You throws your backbone : clean out of sight

You did cause me to weep : you did cause me to moan
You did cause me : to leave my home
I cried last night : and the night before
And I swore : not to cry no more
In eighteen hundred : and ninety-nine
He got killed on that streetcar line
They took him down : that smoky road
Brought him back : on that cooling board
Says run here mama : and fall in your daddy's breast
These blues : going to let me rest

Said come in here : and you shut that door
He got shot : with a forty-four
I got a brand new pistol : and a box of balls
Going to shoot that woman : just to see her fall
You ??? *those stitches* : in the
He dug those potatoes : with the pocketknife
I'm going to town : hurry back
I'm going to show your people : how to ball the jack
She got good jelly : she sells it hot
I know here's something : that a man can't buy
Twenty-five cents : is the regular price
There's fifty cents : you can buy her twice
She pulls her dress : up above her knees
She shakes her shimmy : to who she please

Take your time kind mama : I'm going to do it just as slow as I can
I might start shimmying : don't let nobody in
Make your bed up higher : and turn your lamp way low
I'm going to hug and kiss you : ain't coming here no more
Make your lamp up higher : and turn your lamp around
Look out your back door : see me leave this town

The day you left me : you throwed me down
You didn't hurt me so bad babe : talk over town
Because I'm broke : I'm down and out
You ever quit me : and put me out
Went to the nation : and the territor'
Going to catch me the first train : I've got to go
You press my jumper : my overalls
Went to the station : meet the Cannonball
I'd rather ride : this ??? line
To be uneasy : be treated right
I give my money : and a diamond ring
Now come her partner : beat me shaking that thing
The day you left me : won't wear no black
I write you a letter : come sneaking back

You don't believe I'm traveling : on the road somewhere
Get your book : and count come and count the days I'm gone
You can go to *Moosefall* : find me there
Yes if I drink smoky : find me on the road somewhere
You can talk about your brick house : but you ought to see mine
It ain't so pretty : but it ??? fine
I got up this morning : looked at the rising sun
Can't nobody run me : like them bloodhounds done
I got up in my stockings : tipping across the floor
Scared the bloodhounds : are rapping upon my door
Now chickens on my back : and there's the hounds on my track
I dropped my head : and I couldn't stop to look back
I could hear those pistol balls : zooming by my head
I believe to my soul : they going to kill me dead
I got up this morning : just about the break of day
I could hear *a bunch of* bloodhounds : a-coming down my way
I got up this morning : fell down across my bed
I could hear something pushing : all around my head

My woman woke up this morning : dollar in her hand
Two bits for the monkey : six bits for her man

I hocked everything : from my hat down to my shoes
So now sweet mama : got those doggone hockshop blues

Now right is right : wrong is wrong
Ain't no harm : to sing a little song
Uncle Bud went home : just like they said
Stuck a match : caught a man in his bed
If I go home : about half past ten
Put the key in the hole : and can't get in
Now Lucy came home : with a big excuse
She left there tight : but she come back loose
I had a little kitty : I called her mine
Way in the night : I could hear her cry
We shoot a little dice : bound to have a little fun
Law walked up : and away we run
I asked the lady for a drink : this is what she said
I don't have the white : but I have the red
Some folks hates it : call it a sin
You see women : give money to men

I went down in the alley : trying to sell my coke today
And a woman run out and hollered : scared my mule away
I went with iceman Jackson : he sold me ice and coke
But he blowed in all his money : buying sweet jellyroll
We stopped on Eighteenth and Federal : just two blocks west of State
And when he got up under that ??? : well he would not wait
She said money don't excite me : and that we all know well
But Jackson showed her fifty dollars : and she almost fell
She had wind like the greyhound : and she sure could run
And Jackson got down like a reindeer : and he runned her some

Tell me pretty daddy : what's the matter now
Are you trying to quit me : and you don't know how
I'd rather be dead : buried in the sea
Than to have the man I love : say he don't want me
Lord Lord : Lordy Lordy Lord
Oh the man I love : treats me like a dog
I'd rather see : my coffin come rolling in my door
Than to hear the man I love : say I don't want you no more

I hear these women raving : about their monkey-man
About their trifling husbands : and their no-good friends
These poor women sit around : all day and moan
Wondering why : their wandering papa don't come home
Now when you got a man : don't never be on the square
Because if you do : he'll have a woman everywhere
I never was known : to treat no one man right
I keep them working hard : both day and night
I've got a different system : and a way of my own
When my man starts kicking : I let him find another home
I get full of good liquor : walk the streets all night
Go home and put my man out : if he don't act right
You never get nothing : by being an angel child
You better change your ways : and get me awhile
I want to tell you something : I wouldn't tell you a lie
Wild women are the only kind : that do

Early this morning : when everything was still
My daddy said he was leaving : though it's against my will
He said I'm leaving mama : and your crying won't make me stay
The more you cry : the further I'm going away
A man is like a car : that you have to overhaul
Keep him three or four weeks : and you can't get along at all
I gave him everything : from a diamond on down
The next thing I give him : will be six feet of ground

You can always tell : when your best man don't want you around
He will come home at night : turn the bed upside down
My heart's full of sorrow : tears come rolling down
Because my baby : was Kentucky bound
The pale moon shines : down on the mountain still
Way down in old Kentucky : mid those high blue hills
Shine on old moon : harvest moon shine on
Because old moon you'll be shining : when I'm dead and gone
I'm going to tell my mama : when I go back home
Tell her the folks up here : won't let my Kentucky man alone

Hello Central : give me long-distance please
I'm begging with tears in my eyes : and down on my bended knees
Hello Central : give me Mr Henry Brown
What you say you were calling : a storm has blown the wires down
Listen long-distance : can you send a telegram
Do this please : before I fall down *left in a jam*
You just tell him : he better hurry home
Because I'm tired : of making all these nights alone

Takes a southern woman : to sing this southern song
Lord I'm worried now : but I won't be worried long
When I was downtown : I wouldn't take no one's advice
But I ain't going to let : that same bee sting me twice
Because I'm going back : where the weather suits my clothes
Down where there ain't no snow : and the chilly winds never blow
I don't want no northerner : no northern black or brown
Southern men will stick by you : when the northern men can't be found
You ever been south : you know just what I mean
Southern men are all the same : from Kentucky to New Orleans
I'm going back south : where I can get my hambone boiled
These northern men : are about to let my poor hambone spoil

The blues came down my alley : and stopped right at my door
They made me feel : like I've never felt before
I'm a good-hearted woman : never done nobody wrong
But the better I treat my daddy : the worse we get along
If you don't want me daddy : please tell me what to do
I've never loved nobody daddy : like I'm loving you
I've got ten little puppies : twelve little shaggy hound
It takes all twenty-two : to run my good man down

Daddy oh daddy : won't you answer me please
All day I stood by your coffin : trying to give my poor heart ease
I rubbed my hands over your head : and whispered in your ear
And I wonder if you know : that your mama's near
You told me that you loved me : and I believed what you said
And I wished that I could fall : here across your coffin dead
When I left the undertakers : I couldn't help but cry
And it hurts me so bad : to tell the man I love goodbye

Early this morning : the blues come walking in my room
I said blues please tell me : what are you doing here so soon
He looked at me and smiled : but yet they refused to say
I asked him again : and they turned and walked away
The first thing they told you : your man you're going to lose
At first I didn't believe it : but I found that it was true
Blues oh blues : you know you been here before
The last time you were here : you made me cry and walk the floor

The time has come : for us to part
I ain't going to cry : it won't break my heart
Because I'm through with you : and I hope you don't feel hurt

You are like an old horseshoe : that's had its day
You're like an old shoe : I must throw away
You're like an old ship : that sprung a leak
You ain't young no more : and your loving is weak
You ain't got no money : you're down and broke
You're just an old has-been : like a worn out joke

Old pal old pal : you stole my man away
But that's all right : I'll get him back some day
You stole my man : between midnight and day
And if I catch you old pal : I sure will make you pay
Why should you : have a daddy of your own
Old pal old pal : you better let my man alone
Old pal you said : two friends could understand
But that's no sign : we should take each other's man

Going down to the river : take a rope and a rock
Tie it around my neck : and jump off the dock
Ain't no one : can change my mind
I've been mistreated : and I don't mind dying
Going to get me some poison : kill myself
Because the man I love : has put me on the shelf
If he didn't want me : he didn't have to lie
The day I see him : that's the day he'll die
Baby : you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing : I'm laughing just to keep from crying
A crooked man's worse : than crooked dice
With dice you lose your money : with your man you lose your life
I'm going to get me a razor : and a gun
Cut him if he stands still : shoot him if he runs

I got a coal-black mare : but Lord how that horse can run
Yes she win every race : man you don't see how it's done
I give her three gold teeth : I put earings in her ears
There ain't no use a-worrying : I do swear the stuff is here
I cut her mane : I put streamline shoes on her feet
Ain't a horse in the country : I do swear my horse can't beat
Say she foxtrot and pace : and I rode that horse today
Yeah when morning comes : she had never broke her gait
She going to the race track at midnight : and I rode her all night long
Yeah when morning come : she had never changed her weight
She's a coal-black mare : she's got long black curly mane
Well I'll follow that horse : man in any land

I went down in Death Valley : among the tombstones and dry bones
That's where poor me will be : Lord when I'm dead and gone
Now if I should die : I should die before my time

Now bury me mama : low down in the sand
Now bury me mama : where I won't bother your next old man
Oh bye bye baby : I said goodbye
Death Valley is my home : mama I want to die
Tell all the women : please come dressed in red
They going down Sixty-One Highway : that's where the poor boy he fell dead
Wear your patent leather slippers : mama put out your morning gown
You going to follow poor Crudup : down to his burying ground

That's all right mama : that's all right for you

Because the woman I love : done throwed me away

If I get lucky mama : with my train fare home

Well that mean old old Frisco : and that lowdown Santa Fe
Done took my babe away : Lord and blowed back at me
Yes my mama told me : papa told me too
Son every woman scream in your face : Lord she ain't no friend to you
Lord I wonder : do she ever think of me
Well I wonder I wonder : will my babe come back to me
Yes I'm standing and looking : watching that Southern whistle blow
Well she didn't catch that Southern : Lord now where did the woman go
Lord I ain't got no : special rider here
I might leave : because I don't feel welcome here

Do anything mama : tell the truth don't mean no lie
I have so many hard-working women : tell you men I don't mean no jive

You have to step on the gas : to make them climb the hill
Never mind never mind baby : I got my eyes on you

I don't want nothing for Christmas : but my baby back to me

The blue sky is my blanket : and the moonlight is my spread
The rock is my pillow : that is where I rest my head
A ghost and a night owl : they come to see me sometime
And a Gypsy women : she comes and reads my mind
The woman that I was loving : she did not mean me no good
She give me so much trouble : I had to move back in the woods
I am friendless and I'm lonesome : people you would be the same old way
If the woman that you were loving : would mistreat you both night  and day

They put ashes in my whiskey : they put strychnine in my glass
Lord I went out car-riding with them : and they carried me too fast
She put [castor oil, black drops] in my coffee : with that [black drops, castor oil] in my tea
Lord she's the meanest old woman : that a man most ever seen
I believe I believe : that they trying to carry me down
Lord the way they are feeding me : that they don't want me around
She carries a razor in her pocket : with them frowns all in her face
Lord I believe some other good joker : trying to root me out of my  place

I'm going to write you a letter : my wife and I ain't going to do right no more
I know the way you treat me baby : Lord you did not want me no more
What I've got on my mind : ain't nobody in this world can tell
And if I never see you no more baby : Lord I sure do wish you well
Now I'm having bad luck : and bad luck I can't understand
Got me out here scuffling mama : trying to make it if I can
Baby baby : I ain't going to worry with you no more
Lord I'm going down the country : let you have Mr so-and-so

You got bad blood mama : I believe you need a shot
Now turn over here mama : let me see what else you got
I doctors on women : I don't fool around with men
All right take it easy here mama : whilst I stick my needle in
Lord your ways is so loving : and your skin is nice and soft
Lord if you keep on drunk mama : you going to make me break my needle off
Lord my needle is in you baby : and you seem to feel all right
And when your medicine go to coming down : I want you to hug me tight
Yeah your medicine come now baby : put your [foot, leg] up side the wall
I don't want to waste none of it mama : I want you to have it all

You is built for speed : and fast just like twenty grand
I would give more for you now : than a farmer would for land
I'm a well-trained jockey : won't you please ma'am let me ride
I may not give a ride like you old jockey : but I'll try to make you satisfied
If you let me get in your saddle : and just try me one time
Lord I may can do something : baby that might change your mind
Twenty grand is the fastest race horse : that ever run around a track
And if you let me get in your saddle mama : I may ride the way you like
Just let me get in your saddle baby : I ain't going to never do no wrong
I'm a good jockey rider : and I don't stay there too long

Have you ever been low in spirits : mama and you didn't know what was on your mind
Lord it hurts you so bad sometimes : Lord you can't keep from crying
The house where you were living : it don't [even] look right no more
And you can't find no consolation : nowhere in the world you go
Then you wonder what did you ever do : to make your poor heart ache and pain
Lord it hurts you so bad : to hear somebody call Mr so-and-so's name
I looked for you Sunday morning : till Monday in the afternoon
But I hope you'll be here Tuesday morning : hope you will be here Tuesday morning soon
If I don't never see you no more : please drop me a post card
Lord you know the way that you left me : mama it almost broke my heart

Your picture has faded : mama that hangs up on the wall
It's been hanging there so long : I can't see your face at all
Even my old house seems haunted : mama and there ain't nobody around
Sometime it seem like at night : that the old house is falling down
I can hear my back door slamming : [seem like] I can hear a little baby crying
Lord I wonder baby : have you got me on your mind
My old clock is [still] ticking : that hangs up on the wall
But now you gone and left me : and I can't see your face at all

Please don't mistreat me : if you don't want me around
Lord don't be mad with me baby : because your good man have left this town
You say you don't [even] love me : you don't even love yourself
I know there ain't a room in your heart for me : mama you loving someone else
I got myself a mama : she always keep me feeling blue
Lord she act just like the weather : and I don't know what she is going to do
If I really loved you baby : I would not tell you no lies
Lord I wouldn't say hard things to you mama : to make you hang your head and cry

Mama why should I be worried : and why should I be so blue
Lord it's all on account : of all on account of you
How can I sleep and keep from worrying : how can I laugh and keep from crying
Lord every time I turn my back : you always doing something to change my mind
I just flutters when I see you : like a little bird up in his nest
Lord sometime I think I love you : sometime I think I love my little gal the best
I can't keep from worrying : Lord I can't keep from telling you lies
Lord I would do all right with you baby : but you know you try to be too wise

Now this was my sad story : I never will forget the day
It was in the year of nineteen thirty-five : on the twenty-sixth day of May
As I walked into my bedroom : crowd all gathered around
They was standing seemed to be in mourning : with their heads all hanging down
In the midst there stood a doctor : he was standing gazing on
The only woman in the world that I ever loved : she's gone she's gone
Now I'm left here all alone : all in this great big world alone
That's the end of my happy days : and I can't have no more happy home
On the bed there laid a letter : said be as good as you can be
Lord I'm sorry you couldn't be here now : to have the last few words with me

Now you must have a heart : like a rock in the sea
I been begging you baby : babe please don't leave
My nights are getting lonely : my days are getting long
Now tell me baby : I did not do no wrong
I don't want to hurt your feelings : either make you mad
I love you : better than anything I ever had
I like you baby : I like to see you smile
But I like to please you : every once in a while

I heard somebody calling me : papa don't you want to go
Mama dee-da-da calling me : papa so-and-so
Down in the land of California : sweet home Chicago
I begged you all night baby : all the night before
If I ever did you wrong : I won't do that no more
All last night baby : I tried to talk to you
But you told me : there was nothing I could do
I been good to you baby : did everything that I could
Now you want to leave me : don't mean me no good
Oh babe oh baby : down on my bended knees
Begging you now baby : don't leave me please
Oh babe oh baby : don't leave me now
All alone by myself baby : won't be satisfied

Now I walked over to the table : and I picked up my telephone
But the line was busy : or if it ain't nobody home
Give me long long-distance : I wonder what's wrong with my line
Lord I just want to talk awhile : to that little old girl of mine
All right operator : maybe it ain't nobody home
But I'm sitting here wondering : why is my baby gone
I'm calling long-distance : and I wonder where could she be
Lord I wonder is she listening : and won't even answer me

I woke up this morning moaning : with the worried blues on my mind
I was thinking about someone : who were left behind
It's oh Lord Lord : please get him off of my mind
I can't eat for dreaming : and I can't rest for crying
I'm going back to my baby : going to knock on my baby's door
I'm going to ask my pretty mama : baby can't you use me no more
Baby : can I lay down here till day
I'm a poor boy : and I got nowhere to stay
Love is like water : it turns off and on
When you think you got a good girl : Lord she done turn off and gone

Elm Street painted in brass : Main Street painted in gold
I got a good girl live on East Commerce : I wouldn't mistreat her to save nobody's soul
Hey Billiken : these Elm Street women don't mean you no good
When your back is turned : they with every man in the neighborhood
These Elm Street women : Billiken they don't mean you no good
If you want to make a good woman : have to get on *Hospital* Avenue

Don't the moon look pretty : shining through the trees
Don't your house look lonesome : when your good girl is fixing to leave
Down on my knees this morning : I prayed to the good Lord above
Please let me live one more time : with the good girl that I love
I'm going to get me a wire : stretched across the deep blue sea
So when my good girl gets worried : she can sit down and talk to me

I'm going to build me a little mansion : on Central Avenue
So I can stick my head out the window : and see what my wicked women will do
Lord I got a pretty mama : lives on Central Avenue
Lord if that woman left and quit me *now* : what in the world that I would do
I pray to heaven Lord : I seen my pretty mama up there
She had one foot loose : and *curled up with the air*
Good girl used to live here : don't live here no more
Left here early this morning : carried all of her clothes
Boy I'd *better see my good girl* : leave me in this town
I'd beat the train to the *crossroads* : and I'd burn the depot down
Lord pretty mama I wonder : what you trying to do
*She make it trying* to run with me : and my buddy too
I'm going to West Texas : Lord I'm going to stay
Some little brownskin woman : *stepping* in my way

Well the sun rose this morning : and laid down on my floor
When I ended my dreams : it was all around my door
Good morning blues : what makes you come so soon
Here early this morning : *crying ???* soon
Now blues and trouble : boys what a nagging ache
These old women now baby : running from man to man
Just tell me pretty mama : what you trying to do
You didn't do no more : than I looked for you to do
You leave me laughing : some day you come back crying
You been gone so long darling : wear you off of my mind
Lord Lord : Lord Lordy Lord Lord
The girl I loving : treat me like a dog
My heart's in trouble : mind's in misery
Got the blues so bad : I really can't hardly see

Well I'm so glad : I'm twenty-one years old today
Lord I'm so glad : my baby can't treat me that a-way
Oh babe : what you want poor me to do
Driving a coal wagon babe : give all my money to you
Oh babe : don't play me for no fool
Lord I ain't no plumber : and I ain't nobody's stool
I send it to the river : river to the deep blue sea
Now your monkey ways babe : don't take no effect on me
Oh babe : don't make no fool of me
Lord I'm three time seven : baby why can't you see
That's why I'm so glad : I'm twenty-one years old today
Lord I'm three times seven : I'm going to have my way

I can't go down : that big road by myself
If I can't carry you : I carry someone else
I asked him how about it : and he said all right
I asked him how long : and he said all night
I asked him how about it : said he didn't know how
But I will do you mama : like a calf will do a cow
I'm a traveling woman : I got a traveling mind
If you don't take me back daddy : sure going to lose your mind
My mother said : six months before I was born
She was going to have a good child : wouldn't never stay at home
I feel like crying : ain't got no tears to spare
I had a happy home : and I wouldn't stay there

Tallahatchie River rising : Lord it's mighty bad
Some peoples on the Tallahatchie : done lost everything they had
Some people in the Delta : wondering what to do
They don't build some levees : I don't know what become of you
High water rising : get me troubled in mind
I got to go : and leave my daddy behind
Lord this water rising : and I sure can't swim
But if it keeps on rising : sure going to follow him
Going pack my suitcase : go back to Tennessee
But this Tallahatchie River : done got the best of me

Mmm : hey hey hey hey
Now the man I love : treats me like a dog
I've got a twelve pound daddy : and eight pound one too
And if my twelve pound one won't come : my eight pound one will do
I'm going to build me a castle : out of ice and snow
So when my blues come around : I can freeze them from my door
Oh pretty daddy : will you please tell me what to do
I will do anything : baby to satisfy you
And it's one thing baby : that I can't understand
If you are *loving* me : I don't want no partnership man

I started to heaven : but I changed my mind
But I'm going to Little Rock : where I can have better time
Yes when I go to Little Rock : I can go three days without
I tell people there : it's a wonderful town
This is the place : where I have long to be
Because where I come from : the mens have mistreated poor me
Oh I don't know why : they treat me so lowdown and cruel
And if you don't want me baby : you don't have to use me as no fool

Hey hey : death bells in my ear
It 'tain't going to be long : before they going to ring me away from here
I lay down last night all night : and the night before
Going back home to mama : won't have to lay down no more
I'm a stranger here : they're sending out in the sea
I'm broke and hungry : not a bite to eat
Going to stand right here : catch the first old gal I see
I'm going to beg her to take me : see what she make of me
I'm going to ask my rider : would she set my trunk outdoors
I don't mean quitting you : but I got another place to go
The woman I had : these men must have had her *foiled*
She loved me all this summer : but she put me out this fall
I began to study : and the wind begin to blow
I couldn't figure no place : for a man like me to go
My mama's dead : my papa's across the sea
That leaves no one : to love and care for me

Just as happy : woman as I can be
Because the woman I'm loving : is going back to Kankakee
Woman I'm loving : done mistreated me
For another new morning : going to need your friend again
Treat me : like someone you never seen

Blues ain't nothing : good man on your mind
Well it keep you worried : bothered all the time
When you see me : with my head hung down
I ain't got the blues : but another gal on my mind
I'm going away baby : to see what could do
I done all I could : can't get along with you
I went to the station : I looked up on the board
Well my train ain't here : but it's somewhere on the go

Said good morning captain : said good morning shine
'Tain't nothing the matter : captain but I just ain't going
I don't mind working : captain from sun to sun
But I want my money : captain when payday come
Work me all this summer : and you started on this fall
Now I've got to take Christmas : in my overalls
If you good men : want to keep her out of town at night
Just feed her little pork chops : suits her appetite
Lord it 'tain't no telling : what a Mississippi gal will do
She will get your money : then *poor gam* at you
It's one pretty mama : going to need a friend again
You can sing this song : when you want me to be your friend
Hey tell me woman : where did you stay last night
For your shoes unfastened : and your skirt don't fit you right

I says go on girl : don't sing them blues to me
Because I'm sweet : as any man can be
She even told me : to my face
That any old rounder : sure can take my place
Said I'm getting tired : of your lowdown ways
I'm going back : to my babe today
So come on girl : honey you can't bluff
I'm going to tip out tonight : and I'm going to strut my stuff

I went down on the corner : with my money in my hand
To kill my woman : about loving another man
You see it's grieving me : oh it's grieving me
Going to pack my grip : beat it back to Tennessee
I'm so sad and lonely : love has been refused
Can't have no loving : but I still have the blues
They call me pretty papa : swellest man in town
Women all screaming about me : but I can't give up my brown
Daddy's got the washboard : mama's got the tub
Sister's got the liquor : and brother's got the jug
My water pipe's all rusted : water's running cold
Someone's in the basement : trying to find the hole

Just another evening : wasted away
Spending and a-lending : and it left me broke today
Run here pretty mama : sit down on your daddy's knee
I'll tell you : how these women made a perfect fool of me
I wasted lots of money : went out every night
My pals done all forsake me : and the times is getting tight
I'm feeling like an outcast : looking like a tramp
Can't price a post card : can't even buy a stamp
Ah you used to call me papa : you used to call me dunce
You used to call me daddy : and you used to love me once
Some folks need the ice : some folks need the snow
If I could get you back : mama I wouldn't need nothing more

You may be little : you may have a tender snoot
But I know what you is mama : when you start to root
You go before the butcher : try to put on your stunt
He can stick a knife in you : and you won't even grunt
I see you got your squeal : you got your snoot
Still you got your grunt : but you done lost your root
Oh mama : you may have your snoot
Still you got your grunt : but you done lost your root

All dolled up : looking keen
Like a girlie : in her teens
Strutting : down the avenue
Making eyes : and flirting too
Now the other night : when I phoned
You had another : in your home
Parts of me : big and fat
Can't blame nobody : for that
I want your love : I can't refuse
But I don't want it : if it's ever been used
Some is tall : some is cute
Some is sweet : and some is true
I don't mean : to speak so bold
Can't use it : if it's forty years old

Something pounding : in my breast
When I lay down : to take my rest
Horrid nightmares : scary dreams
Then the blues : steps on the scene
Oh maybe it's the blues : that keeps me worried all the time
If I could lose these weary blues : that's on my mind
Happiness that comes around : but never comes to stay
If I only had someone : just to drive my tears away

I had a brown in my town : sweet as any gal could be
I loved my gal with all my might : she didn't love nobody but me
The other night : a man named Willie come and stole my gal away
Now I'm feeling down and out : and I've got the blues today
Say if you see my gal : don't you tell her what I've done
I got the blues : I going to sing them all night long
Now folks if you see my gal : tell her that I'm gone
Feel like riding : if it takes me all night long
Now back to the levee I'm bound : I'm through with high yellows and browns
Now I'm going to the levee : because my gal done turned me down
Now say folks if you see my gal : tell her that I'm gone
I feel like leaving : if it takes me all night long

Take me back sweet mama : try me one more time
If I don't satisfy you : I'll break my backbone trying
You lay in your bed : with your face to the wall
Thinking if you die : would that end it all

Get up on the table : pull off that gown
Raise up that right leg : let the left one down
Pull off them stockings : that silk underwear
The doctor's got to cut you mama : Lord knows where
Got two or three tumors : shaped like a cube
Two or three leaks : in your inner tube
Bring on that ether : bring on that gas
The doctor's got to cut you mama : yas yas yas
Four monkey wrenches : and a two-horse shay
Pair of old britches : and a bale of hay
Your ribs was kind of loose : they moved about
If I hadn't've sewed you up : everything would fell out
I put in new tubes : hide the exhaust
I went into your hood : and cleaned your spark plugs off
Your body's kind of weak : now don't be hard
From now on be careful : with them connection rods
Now your body's kind of weak : don't be hard
Go kind of easy : with them connection rods

Get up on this table : pull off that gown
Raise up that right leg : let that left one down
Pull off them stocking : that silk underwear
The doctor's got to cut you : mama don't know where
You got two or three tumors : shape like a cube
Two or three leaks : in your inner tube
Bring on that ether : bring on that gas
The doctor's got to cut you mama : yas yas yas
Four monkey wrenches : two-horse shay
Pair of old britches : and a bale of hay
Your ribs was kind of loosened : they moved about
If I hadn't sewed you up : everything would fell out
I put in new tubes : tightened up the exhaust
Went into your hood : and cleaned your spark plugs off
Your body's kind of weak : don't be hard
From now on you be careful : with them there connection rods

Tell me pretty mama : where'd you stay last night
Shoes ain't buttoned : and you don't smell right
Now you all drawed up : you look half drunk
Your hair ain't combed : and you smell like a skunk
Train's in the depot : boxcar's on the track
My gal come home : with a tie across her back

Now when I fix it lady : sure will be mighty good
I fixed so many of them : all over this neighborhood

I had a sweet woman : she done turned sour on me
I had a good woman : but the men wouldn't let her be
I had a new way of loving : but I done lost my stroke
I had a new gal : I lost her when I got broke
Now I'm a real kind fellow folks : and that ain't so bad
But I just ain't got them things : I once have had
I got my mind all made up : and I'm going to leave this town
I'm a-going so far : till the women can't run me down
Now I had a speak-easy: but the police come and closed it down
Now it sure is a hard thing : to sell booze around this town
I got a woman down in Florida : got two up in Tennessee
Got one in Indiana : keeps on pulling after me
Now the angels keep singing : the moon shines down at night
But the good Lord knows : that the women don't treat me right

Oh set right down : and let's have some fun
My wife's gone out : on a all-night run
Oh take this : take some of that
Take anything : in the doggone flat
I'll fry some meat : cook some bread
You get sleepy : there's a great big bed
Oh take this liquor : drink this wine
Let's get drunk : and have one good time
Take off your shirt : hang it on the chair
Take off your socks : and give your feet some air
I'm drunk and disorderly : I don't care
If you want to : you can pull off your underwear

Now if you want me to love you : here's what you got to do
You want me to love you mama : and make [me, you] love [you, me] too
I got to have my loving : when my habit get on
Start at nine in the evening : and love me all night long
You got to get up early in the morning : fix your lunch
And get out early : with that scuffling bunch
If I wake up at night : and I wants to eat
It's up to you : to get me some of that western meat
You got to take all your money : throw it against the wall
You take what sticks : and I'll take what falls
Take a butcher knife : cut off your head
Send me a telegram : that your heart is dead

Scuffling have got so hard : seem like I can't even make a dime
I must a-have the wrong woman : seem like can't save money all the time
I never want another women : that don't do nothing but hang around
She will ??? to your weakness : she will keep you with a turned-down hand
Life have gotten miserable : seem like no more happiness to be made
But life is really too short : to be worried about them old no-good ways
Good Book trying to tell us : where there's a will there's a way
But it seem like the *many ways draining* out of me : more and more every day

Lord grief will kill you : it will get you down to skin and bones
And that devil *brother be upstairs* now : Lord after you are dead and gone
I once grieved so hard : until I wake up weeping in my sleep
But after you continue this life boys : you'll be living down in some graveyard deep
Women now about nowadays they don't want to love nobody : and don't worry about the man behind the *left*
Boys you better watch them women : because they're just slipping up the kingdom's steps

Now baby let's stop our foolishness : and try to renew love over again
Because I can't stay here in this world *after* : in this condition my poor heart's in
Now baby I'm going to make you this promise : I make our home happy for you in every way
But I want you to take care of my money baby : and please don't give my belongings away
Now baby you know I love you : now why can't we get along
Maybe some day you will consider baby : Lord and acknowledge that you have done wrong

Boys I ain't doing no good : this slow death is killing me
Every time *you going out swinging* : I'm just as blue as I can be
My mind in such a condition : until I hardly know the days in the week
Baby you give me plenty trouble : but some day you bound to see
When I'm sleeping deep down in my grave : don't let no high *flat flappers* worry you
You can just step out in any yard : that old jimson weed will sure ??? you
Now boys you can be cute with your woman : and see won't she do you dirty *ass*
She'll forever keep you working : working with your coffin on your back

I'm cold in hand : can't get nothing here
I'm hungry as a hound : I can't travel nowhere
I can't help but worry : how my good friend done
Spent my money by the dollar : now won't give me nickel one
Mama told me : times and times again
Anybody laughs in my face : just can't be my friend
Lord look down on poor me : pity my worried cares
Help me to rise once more : I'm going to change my free-hearted ways
Just give me one friend : to keep me from feeling so sad
Lord you know I want a friend : like the one that Adam had

Come here pretty mama : come here right now
I've been waiting on you so long : till I'm burning down
I'm waiting on you : I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting on you baby : tell me what you going to do
I know a good woman well : something going on wrong
You ain't never kept me waiting : this lonesome long
I wait all last night : all the night before
If I have to wait tonight : I'm going to pack my trunk and go
If you don't want me baby : just leave me alone
I can get another woman : to carry your business on
If you meant : to treat me right
You wouldn't keep me waiting : all day and night
That's all right baby : if you don't want me no more
There many more women : just rearing to go

Now I talked and I talked : now I ain't got no more to say
Hand me down my jumper : and I'll be on my lonesome way
I tried everything baby : don't nothing do no good
I can't blame you honey : I'd be the same way if I could
You came here from the country : just as green as green could be
Now you're a wise city city : and you dodge all over me
Well I ain't got no more to say : and I ain't going to chase you around
Some day I'll be running : with the biggest shots in town

I saying I sad and lonesome : Lord what I'm going to do
Say I'm going buy me a terraplane : I swear and a V-Eight too
Well I'm going to put them both there together : put them out on the road
Paint both show mama : got a heavy load
Now I saying I sad and lonesome : Lord what I'm going to do
Say I'm going to step on that accelerator : till that gas come through
Say my gal just quit me now man : pulled in another lane
Didn't want to come back : till I bought that airplane
Crying please Frank : please let me ride with you
Say I got room for two or three more : I swear and you too
Says stop now Frank : let's get a sack of flour
How can I stop this airplane : making ninety mile an hour
Crying please Frank : please let me ride with you
Say I can *peel off* that accelerator : and that gas come through

Hitler cutting the world : gotten disturbed
Uncle Sam better decide : and gotten blood in his eye
You got to get together : you got to get together
Got to closen up together : join one hand in hand
Mussolini jumped back : up in the sack
Hitler kicked him out : so he couldn't get back
Uncle Sam called the men down : name by name
He ain't together : but they ready just the same
Uncle Sam need a champ :
A well trained man : when you leave camp
Well left my woman : standing in the door
Crying Lord they mustn't let him : please don't go

Now there is something : you say that you expect
Now come and tell me what it is : that I neglect
Come and tell your papa : what you want me to do
Now just before : I got from you
Get up every morning : at half past three
Ease out to your job : without disturbing me
Now when you come back : you must have plenty of jack
Because any *??? still* : really hurts your papa's back
I want you to work hard : for me and my brother
I want you to come back from work : looking just like first one thing and then another


Says I never like to hurry : I just take my time

Now here's all I ask of you : kind man
I want an answer : I can understand
How you get up every morning : at half past three
Bring the coal and kindling : make a fire for me
Cook your own breakfast : fix your lunch
Get your pick and shovel : work with that construction bunch
*Seven eighty-three* : without neglect

I swear to God : this boogie too mean
Get a half pint of moonshine : two or three bottles of beer
I believe : I'll pitch the boogie right here
Get all your moonshine : get all your beer
Close the door : ain't going to let nobody up here

Let me be your wiggler : until your wobbler come
If she beats me wiggling : she got to wobble some
Women crying danger : but I ain't raising my hand
I got a way of loving : they just can't understand
Men they call me oven : they say that I'm red-hot
They say I got something : the other gals ain't got
I can strut my pudding : spread my grease with ease
Because I know my onions : that's why I always please
Wild about coffee : but I'm crazy about China tea
But this sugar daddy : is sweet enough for me
One John in the city : one lives up on the hill
But the man I'm loving : lives down in Jacksonville

I moaned I moaned : I cried the whole night long
I was wondering : where in the world my man done gone
I'd rather be dead : in some lonesome place
Than for my man : keeps treating me this a-way
When you see two of you women : going hand in hand
You can judge by that : they got one of the other one's man
I went to the Gypsy : to get my fortune told
*Said the evil* is hard luck : doggone your hard-luck soul
I said Lord Lord : something going on wrong
Because the man I love : done been here and gone
I turned around : and two of them Gypsies I told
Say Nellie needs a man : most anywhere you go
I went to my bedside : hung my head and cried
Got a letter from my man : that my man had died
I hung my head : and I cried the whole night long
Said I'm right upset : and I've got those weeping blues

I'm telling you this morning : I'm tired of you searching my house
I have a notion this morning : beating you up and throwing you out
The hell with the search warrant : go look and see what you can find
You ain't never found no liquor : and you searched my house two or three times
Give me a break : don't make me pay no fine
That judge is going to lick me : because I been here so many times

I'm guilty kind old judge : please treat me nice and kind
For I'll stay home and try my best : to get money to pay my fine
I never seen : a judge as mean as you before
Sending me a poor woman : and letting everybody else go
You can do as you please : thirty days won't make me cry
When I come back I'm going to gamble : and sell moonshine all my life

On a Sunday morning : just about half past four
My babe took my hand : said daddy I can't use you no more
Lord I may get better : babe I can't get well
I'm going back to my used-to-be : and baby it's country farewell
Lord I'm worried now : but I won't be worried long
It takes a man like me : to carry this worried song
Baby I've been worried so long : that worrying don't bother me
But ain't nobody here babe : to take pity on poor me
I've got a good girl : and I've got a lazy friend
And if I tell about her : he always tell me where she been
I always will have trouble : until I'm dead and gone
If you will love me mama : you'd never treat me wrong

And I got a letter from my baby : and it said that she was dying
I have to catch this mail train : I'm going back home flying
Now when I came in your town babe : I didn't come here to stay long
Now *do you believe that I gone back to her people* : but my baby knowed that I was gone
Lordy Lordy : Lordy Lordy Lord
The only little girl that I love : she treats me like a dog
I'm going to leave you baby : your crying won't make me stay
But it's just like I told you : you're going to need my help some day
Mama I'm the same man : you just only changed your ways
??? *has beaten* mama : you're going to be sorry some day

I woke up this morning : about half past four
Somebody knocking : on my back door
Yes he rattle this morning : about half past three
Half past four : he want to rattle some more
I got a range in my kitchen : bake bread nice and brown
Get my rattlesnake daddy : turn my damper upside down
I can rattle to the left : rattle to the right
My woman said I believe my rattlesnake daddy : can rattle all night
I rattle every morning : till late at night
Reason why : my rattlesnake mama don't allow me out of her sight
Now the old folks rattling : the young ones too
Ain't nobody rattle : just like the way I do
Yes I rattled this morning : about half past ten
Half past nine : I'm going to rattle again

Says I'm going up to town : hat in my hand
Looking for a woman : ain't got no man
Just as well be looking : for a needle in the sand
Looking for a woman : ain't got no man
Says I wouldn't have thought : my baby treat me so
Let another man : stayed at my back door
Mind mama : what you sow
You got to reap : just what you sow
Now if you get you one woman : you better get you two
One for your buddy : other one for you
I's got me a wife : and a sweetheart too
Wife don't love me : my sweetheart do
Cried my gal hollered murder : I ain't raised my hand
Pistol in my pocket : blackjack in my hand
Took my gal : under willow tree
Ought to hear her hollering : don't murder me

I'm not an elephant baby : my snout is large and round
Come to see me mama : when your love some down
If you see my pigmeat mama : tell her to hurry home
Says some lowdown bo-hog woman : have take my sow-pig from home
Yes the reason why I like pigmeat : you know it's nice and sweet
My gal she got something : sure is hard to beat
Yes she's large in the body : she's neat in the waist
My gal she got something : I know you would like to taste
Say you get away from my window : don't knock at my door
I got me a pigmeat woman : don't need sowbelly no more

Which a-way which a-way : do that Blood Red River run
Run from my window : to that rising sun
Now that jumper says loader : please send me six foot of clay
Because that Blood Red River mama : is rising six foot a day
Go down to the camp : and tell my brother Bill
The woman he's loving : is sure going to get him killed
Now the reason why these men here : they sure don't draw no more
Right from the long table : back to that commissary door
Now I love to hear : that M and O whistle blow
I'm in a world of trouble God knows : and I got to go
Now I got two women : and I don't know one apart
There's one in my bosom : t'other one in my heart

I can tell my dog : anywhere I hear him bark
I can tell my rider : if I feel her in the dark
You's a cold-blooded murderer : when you want me out your way
Says that's all right mama : you going need my help some day
And you say you going to put me : woman down in my lonesome grave
Say you must remember : I once have been your slave
And I feel like snapping : my pistol in your face
Let some brownskin woman : be here to take your place
Now you know you didn't want me : when you lied down across my bed
Drinking your moonshine whiskey mama : talking all out your head
Now give me the money baby : I'll catch that train and go
You don't have to kill me : because you don't want me no more
Now if you see my rider : tell her I said bring it home
I ain't had no loving : since my gal been gone
It's two kind of people in the world : that I can't stand
That's a lying woman : and a monkey-man

You talk about loving : that sure is *hit*
You got me to loving : and it just won't quit
Says when I'm on a farm : I hollering whoa haw gee
My gal's uptown : hollering who wants me
Every night I come home : you got your lips painted red
Then come on daddy : let's go to bed
Got great big legs : and a little bitty feet
Something about you : is sweet sweet sweet
You think : you the best-looking gal in town
You do that loving : let it go round and round

I never will forget the day : they transferred me to the county jail
I had shot the woman I love : ain't got no one to come go my bail
Then I sent for my friend : please spare the rod
Then my friend sent me word : Lord the job was too doggone hard
I got friend who's got money : please tell him come go my bail
And my friend sent me word : had no business in the county jail
Then I felt all right : till the judge turned around and frowned
Well I'm sorry for you buddy : but you on your last go-round
I says mmm : ain't got nobody now
Well I got nobody : Lord come and go my bail

I says mmm : I mean come and go my bail

The day I went uptown : caught you looking well
She fell down : her mouth flew open like a country well
Now if you go out : stay all night
??? : *about a* fuss and fight
She's built up a little : and I stay around
She can look up : long as you can look down
Get out now boys : and let me shut the door
I got to *cup them* : before I go
Going to tell you boys : just to call you my pals
A mighty bad sign : to advertise your gals

Had a little girl : she was little and low
Used to love me : but she don't no more
Got a little girl : she stays upstairs
Try to make a living : by putting on airs
Front door shut : back one too
Blinds pulled down : what you going to do
Now I got a little gal : whose name was ball
Give her a little bit : and she took it all
Me and my baby : walking down the street
Dealing everybody : but the chief of police
See my woman : tell her to hurry home
Ain't had no loving : since she been gone
I'll sing this verse : ain't going to sing no more
Hear my gal call me : and I got to go

I hate to see : that rising sun go down
It makes me believe : my woman got me on my last go-round
She used to be mine : but look who got her now
She didn't mean me no good : God knows I couldn't keep her nohow
Said hear me mama : who in the world been telling you
You don't even treat me : nothing like you used to do
Said it may be a week : and it could be a month or two
But when I get lucky gal : I'm coming right back to you
Said a woman I love : she rolled all over the bed
She got the kind of loving : make me talk out of my head
She got coal-black eyes : she got long black curly hair
My baby got something : to lead me most anywhere
I hate to see : that rising sun go down
Lord I got a notion : my woman done and left this town

I was walking around the streets : hear somebody call me and I can't stop
Yeah I was broke and I was hungry : on my way to the pawnshop
Says I went to the pawnshop : great God with my shoes in my hand
Says give me a loan Mr pawnshop man : and help me if you can
Says I called up in Burlington : ask my bossman to help me if he please
Says please hurry up and do something : great God I'm about to freeze
He wrote me and told me : just be sure it's one and two and three
Yeah that pawnshop something : great God that come falling down on poor me
Says I'm about to lose my home : I've done and lost my car
Yeah I'm going down to the pawnshop : see can I pawn my guitar
Says I asked that pawnshop man : what the three balls doing hanging on that wall
Says it's two to one buddy : you don't get your things back out of here at all

You got a little woman : she won't treat you right
Leave in the day : and go back nights
When I called this morning : about half past one
Wake up baby : loving has just begun
Said I know my little woman : going to change her mind
When she walks : she reels and rocks behind
Says I told my baby : about half past two
Wake up mama : loving ain't half through
Says my woman she quit me : keep me worried and blue
Take me in your arms and love me : like you used to do
Then I called her this morning : about half past ten
Wake up mama : loving is just began

You can always tell : when your woman don't want you around
She will put you in jail : six feet in the ground
Yeah locked up in jail : and I just can't help myself
Yeah when I get out : I'm going to find me someone else
Yeah I don't believe no woman : in the whole round world do right
She act like an angel in the daytime : crooked as the devil at night
Said I got the blues : been had them all day long
And when I get my pistol : I won't have them long
Yeah I know my woman : tell you how I know
By the great long hair : and the same little dress she wore

Going to catch that old Greyhound : going to ride from town going to ride from town to town
Then I will find my little woman : don't think she can't be don't think she can't be found
Now Mr redcap porter : won't you help me with my heavy won't you help me with my heavy load
Say now my woman she done and quit me : she's far on down the she's far on down the road
Then I know my little woman : she bound to love she bound to love me some
When she throws her arms around poor me : like the circle around a like the circle around the sun
It's the day before Christmas : let me bring your presents let me bring your presents tonight
Then I will be your Santy Claus : says even if my whiskers says even if my whiskers ain't white

When I had money : I had women and friends for miles around
Yeah now I'm broke : women and friends they can't be found
Says I'm talking about a dollar : I mean a dollar bill
And I just got your dollar : you sure can get your order filled
Said if I could only read : read my little woman's mind
Then I wouldn't be here worrying : and stayed blue all the time
My baby keep me guessing : about things I want to know
Yes she got me doing things : that I never did before

I ain't never loved : but a thousand women in my life

Now the love I have for you woman : God knows it sure is strong
Then if you love me now woman : then you won't do nothing wrong
Now my woman please don't worry : baby while I'm out of your town
Now the love I have for you mama : God knows it can't be turned around
Now my little woman : I said she's sweet as she can be
Every time I kiss her : send a cold chill run over me

I know you from Georgia : but you are all right with me
And if you love me : I wonder what can it be
You was once a good girl : and I had faith in you
But when you started to drinking : Lord that's too bad to do
Drinking won't help you none : crying won't do no good
Before day in the morning : I'll be done left your neighborhood
I'm going to drink one of these nights : and tell my sober thoughts
You know what I mean : give me back everything I bought

I've got Ford engine movements in my hips : ten thousand miles guarantee
A Ford is a car everybody wants to ride : jump in you will see
You can all have the Rolls Royal : your Packard and Studs
Take a Ford engine boys : to do your stuff

I'm so blue : just as blue as I can be
Because every day : is a cloudy day for me
I went to the depot : and looked up on the board
Oh I asked the operator : how long that train been gone
Oh it left here this evening : just about five o'clock
Oh that must have been the train : that my good man caught
Oh what makes my grandpa : love my grandma so
She's got the same old jelly : she had forty years ago
I'm going to Washington : to get my hambone boiled
Because these mens in Atlanta : about to let my hambone spoil

I've have the blues about my money : had the blues because I'm feeling bad
But when my sweet woman quit me : them was the worst blues I ever had
You can ever so much money : and friends of different kinds
But to find someone to love you : I swear they're hard to find
If you should find someone to love you : someone to treat you right
You must be kind and loving : and don't run around at night
Because a woman's very funny : she wants you around her all the time
And find you's been gone : some old rounder might change her mind
Don't you never believe : your woman thinks too much of you
Because there's always been some good man : to beat you doing what you're trying to do

I been drinking and gambling : barrelhousing all my days
But I found someone to love me : I'm going to change my ways
I've always heard it : but now I know it's true
If you mistreat a good woman : she'll turn her back on you
If your woman loves you : she'll stand by you to the end
Nobody can steal your place : you can leave her with a bunch of men
If you get a jealous-hearted woman : be careful what you do
Because there's always somebody : tell her lies on you
Whiskey has been my pleasure : good-time places I've always found
But it's been so different now : since I have fell down

Ain't going to cut no kindling : ain't going to pack no coal
I wouldn't spend a nickel : not to save your soul
Because I'm tired of being mistreated : and the way you do
Want you to tell everybody : that I'm down on you
You taken my money : you left me cold in hand
I'm going to black your eye : you can tell your man
You can go tell the parson : you can tell Chief O'Brien
Before I take you back : I'd rather serve some time
You fooled me once : you fooled me twice
You fooled me just enough : for me to take your life
You left me this morning : you stayed away all day
You must've found something : to keep you away
A nickel for some sugar : a dime for some rice
I'm going to crucify my woman : I'm going to *take her life*

You might be brownskin : I might be black
But what I want baby : you really like
Girl I'm tired of being mistreated : and the way you do
Want you tell everybody : that I'm down on you
I got the money : to buy a house and lot
But what I want baby : you really haven't got
*Nice little partner* :
When I get you home : I'm going to curl your hair
I'm not short : I'm long and tall
I've just got what it takes : to make you crawl
Go out with me baby : in a brand new car
Taking a ride woman : you won't have to walk so far
I had two wives : I want one more
Come in here baby : let us lock the door

Baby stop your way of rambling : stay at home with me sometime
Because this way you going every night : will soon start me with a rambling mind
I don't mind you going : please don't stay the whole night long
Because you made me love you baby : and I miss you when you go
Oh it seems so different : you don't care for me no more
But some day baby : you're going to reap just what you sow

Oh tell me baby : how can it be
You will give everybody : but you won't give me
Ooh baby : the sun begins to shine
Bought you a brand new dress : now you won't pay me no mind
You can spend my money : but you got to stay at home with me
Got to give me lots of loving : and keep my company

Ain't going to cut no kindling : ain't going to buy no corn
I wouldn't spend a quarter : not to save your soul
Because I'm tired of being mistreated : tired of the way you do
Want you to tell everybody : that I'm down on you
You fooled me once : you fooled me twice
You fooled me just enough : for me to take your life
You taken my money : you left me cold in hand
I'm going to black your eyes : you can go tell your man
You can go tell the sergeant : you can tell Chief O'Brien
But before I take it back : I'd rather serve some time
Now you left me this morning : you stayed away all day
You must have found something : to keep you away

I'm going to build me a castle : out of ice and snow
So I can freeze these barefooted women : away from around my door
Just because you were a cheater : I won't give up the game
It don't break my heart to win : when I lose I feel the same
I'm going I'm going : my face you'll never see
But you can kiss my picture : and think the world of me
You accuse me of women : brought your men right before my face
After all your mistreating : no one can take your place

Don't care what you say : don't care what you do
You sure can't quit your woman : and if she put that thing on you
She put that thing on you : she puts it on you right
You can't eat when you get hungry partner : you can't sleep at night
I asked a married woman : to let me be her kid
She said she's afraid she'd put that thing on me : and I couldn't keep it hid
My woman quit me : got her another man
And the way she had that thing on me : I couldn't raise my hand
Now from my experience : I give you your advice
If you got a good woman partner : you'd better treat her right

Mr drayman Mr drayman : back your truck up to my door
Take my trunk down to the station : take it never here no more
I'm in bad luck now : going to catch me somebody's train
Take this whole world through : my luck will be bound to change
Bad luck wakes me every morning : trouble follows me all night long
If I see this ain't no place for me : I'm going back where I belong
I just received a letter : baby won't you please come home
Say the days seem so lonesome : and the nights so long

Believe I'll take : my old-timey rider back
Because she got a way of loving : that her daddy likes
[Awful] nice to meet strangers : just to come and spend the day
But that old-timey rider : can drive your blues away
Did you ever wake up in the morning : and find your rider gone
I know just how it feels : that's why I composed this song
I went to the doctor : for my misery
Said it's nothing but the blues : bearing down on me
And I asked the doctor : [was there] anything that he could do
Says I can't do nothing : till that woman come back to you

I believe I'll try : them bad-luck dice again
If I keep on a-trying : I'll be bound to win
Every man tries to gamble : must have a losing day
So he shouldn't get evil : and throw my dice away
Sometimes I believe : my woman's bad luck to me
Because every time I start to gamble : I can't throw a thing but a three
I lost all I had : everything I had to lose
Even lost the one I love : but I swear I can't lose with you
Nine and five my weakness : ten and four keeps me all in pawn
But if I ever get lucky : I swear I'll have my diamonds on

I am sorry : that I can't take you
You don't know how to gamble : nothing else for you to do
It's not because I love you : but it's just because I've been with you so long
And I know you bound to miss me : baby when I'm gone
Blues have mercy : have mercy on poor me
Oh it might be my fault : please have my sympathy
Baby if you never : never never no more
If you never no more see me : you'll miss me when I go
Mmm baby : believe I will go back home
Going back to the one I love : and acknowledge that I done wrong

A hard-headed woman : just like a bulldog without a chain
She won't never listen to what you say : and that will leave your heart in pain
I've fooled with women : till I lost everything I own
It was a married woman : cause me to lose my home
A woman's so deceitful : but she's so loving and kind
You can pack up your trunk to move : but you will change your mind
You told me you loved me : told my boy friend too
And I would not have been here : if it don't been for you
When a dumb man tries to gamble : he expects to lose
When you got a hard-headed woman : you bound to have the blues

Bad luck and trouble : and the blues without a dime
When a man's got money : the blues don't cross his mind
Always try : to keep a dollar in your hand
When you ain't got no money : your woman get another man
Don't never allow your woman : to talk no baby-talk to you
You can tell by that : they got something in their heads to do
I don't want no woman : if she ain't got a railroad man
Because every day's like Sunday : I mean she's always got a dollar in her hand

Keep your back door locked : baby keeps your windows pinned
If your husband should knock : tell him you're cooking and he can't come in
You ought to buy you a bulldog : to watch us whilst we sleep
So he can see your husband : if he makes a 'fore-day creep
Wake up baby : please don't be so still
Unless you fixing a good way : to get your daddy killed
What's that baby : pecking on your windowpane
Say the stars is shining : I know it can't be rain
The big star's falling : I know it can't be long before day
And I think it's time for me : to make my get-away

You can jive me baby : but I don't believe a thing you say
You just a confidencing woman : and wants to have your way
You can spend my money baby : you can get my loving too
I'll do most anything : just to get along with you
I lay down on my pillow : I rolled from side to side
I didn't have no blues : I just was not satisfied
When you see me coming : my head all hanging down
It's that my sweet woman done quit me : the news all over town
My suitcase is packed : my trunk's already gone
You can tell by that : I won't be here long

Since we been apart : ??? seems strange to me
We been together all these years : and now we can't agree
Somebody must have told you : something to worry your mind
But you should stop your way of living : and stay at home sometime
All my past life : I found till today
I've been trying to listen : to everything you say
If you call that leaving : make the best out of life you can
But you must always remember : your daddy has been your friend
Some of these mornings : you going to long for me
You going to want me baby : just for company

When I was society : the women would not let me be
Now I'm wild and reckless : and nobody cares for me
Some people like religion : some like to rob and steal
But I like to play with my yellow women : and my whiskey right from the still
Cigarettes is my pleasure : and whiskey I do crave
And some long tall and slender : to follow me to my grave
I want to tell you something : happened to me one day
It was a little brownskin woman : stole my heart away

I got a little woman : but I swear she treats me mean
Well she can bake good jellyroll : and she's so nice and clean
She don't make no charges : she don't set no price
But if you roll it once : you want to roll it twice
Now the best doctor in my town : says he never heard tell of such
Little bitty woman : could roll that jellyroll so much
She roll it for Uncle Bill : he like to lost his mind
He want her to keep rolling it : all the time
Oh she mix up her jelly : she rolls it over slow
Gets it all together : then she mix it in her dough

Said I work for you baby : I treat you like a baby child
Well you laughing at me now mama : you'll be crying after a while
Says I give you my money : you treat me like a tramp
I got holes in my shoes : and my feet is getting damp
Oh babe : you oughtn't be so doggone wise
Well you laughing at me now mama : you'll be crying after a while
Says you three time seven : and you knows what you want to do
Sometimes you going to think : about the good things I used to do
You laughed and laughed : until you put my clothes in a pile
Well you laughing at me now mama : you'll be crying after a while
Says I tried so hard : to get along with you
But somehow I couldn't please you : no way I do
You laughed and said : honey I was driving you wild
Well you laughing at me now mama : you'll be crying after a while

Say the holdup man : says don't act tough
Give me your money : I'll treat you rough
Now the little dog : started in to run
The big dog said : pup you just begun
Now I'm going downtown : to see Lizzie Brown
She got the best jellyroll : that is in town
Yes there's one thing : I'm pleased to say
A short-legged woman : can go a long long way
I've got what it takes : I am no child
Makes no mistake : yes I'm running wild

I have never been worried : like I'm worried today
Said my baby is going to leave me : and she's going away to stay
When you get to thinking : about your gal
Says you baby is going to leave you : and taken dime you have
I work all day : I wrestle all night
I did not think my baby : would go out and stay all night

Well I worry I worry : I worries all the time
For the gal I love : she just won't treat me kind
I just worry : worry all the time
Yes I worry : because she won't treat me kind
I just lay down on my bed : I smoke cigarettes all night
Just thinking about my gal : because she ain't doing me right
Says I woke up this morning : feeling so bad
Thinking about the good times : that I once have had
I'm going to pack my suitcase : and down the road I'll go
Because the good times I used to have : I can't have no more

I'm going to leave here : walking too
Just on account : of the way you do
Now you told me : that wouldn't do
It may be me : it may be you
I have been walking : for nights and days
Thinking about the words baby : that you have said
I give you my money : you wouldn't play fair
You taken my money : and gave me the air

I woke up this morning : Lord and my baby was gone
I didn't have no sweet woman : just to hold me in her arms
Yes I'm a poor poor boy : and a great long way from home
I ain't got nobody : just to teach me right from wrong
I'm bound down in trouble : and you know just how I feel
Like a broke down engine : without a driving wheel
That's why I'm leaving : I ain't got no place to go
Because the Good Book says : you going to reap just what you sow

Well I followed my woman : to a place she didn't want me to be
And I seed something : that I did not want to see
Well I seen my friend : give her a bottle of booze
And then what hurt me : she started pulling off her shoes
Says I was in a place : that I did not want to be
And I seen something : that I did not want to see
I said to myself : what you think of that
I seen on the wall : they hung their coat and hat
And then I begin to wonder : what to think of this
And then I saw them : begin to hug and kiss
She was with my friend : instead of being with me
And I seen something : that I did not want to see

I got the key to the highway : billed out and ready to go
I'm going to leave here running : because walking is most too slow
I'm going back to the border : where I'm better known
Because you haven't done nothing : but drove a good man away from home
Give me one more kiss mama : just before I go
Because when I'm leaving here : I won't be back no more
When the moon creep over the mountain : honey I'll be on my way
I'm going to walk this highway : until the break of day
Well it's so long so long baby : I must say goodbye
I'm going to roam this highway : until the day I die

I ain't going down : to Riley Springs no more
When I was there : you drove me from your door
You don't know : how you treated me
You used to love me : and went back to your used-to-be
Riley Springs : is a place to go
But you done me so bad : I won't be back no more
You don't care : what become of me
All you care : is to give your poor heart ease
See now : what you done to me
You broke my heart : and left me in misery

Now you didn't want me : when I was treating you nice and kind
Now it's too late baby : I have changed my mind
You won't act right : when I tried to do right myself
Now it's no no baby : I've got somebody else
It ain't no need : you calling me on my telephone
It's too bad baby : you have broke up your happy home
Now I am through : going from door to door
For what you done : I don't want you no more
Now what you done : you done it to yourself
When I wanted you : you wanted someone else

I tried to get you : to stop raising sand
Before they put you : back in the can
Oh baby : it looks bad for you
Now you hear me talking : I've done all I'm going to do
I tried to love you : a long time ago
I love you : until you drove me from your door
Now love is mighty : rest on either hand
I know you don't love : when you keep on raising sand
I tried to tell you : but you wouldn't understand
Now I'm leaving you : cold in hand
I tried to tell you baby : just before you go
Don't you looking : for me no more

Me and my buddy : I mean he is my friend
We can drink more whiskey : ooo well well than a thousand men
My buddy my buddy : was a dear old friend of mine
When I didn't have the price of whiskey : ooo well well my buddy had it all the time
When I was in trouble : with my hands and feet both tied
I didn't have to look for my buddy : ooo well well he's right there by my side
I know me and my buddy : never will have no falling out
Because we got wise to women : ooo well well we knows what it's all about

When I had you baby : you wouldn't act right
You with your man honey : staying out every night
It was a time : you broke my heart
That's when I found out : that I and you had to part
It's come a day : it won't be long
You will be sorry : that you drove me away from home
When I was in trouble : had my ups and downs
I looked for you baby : you could not be found

I believe I'll write : just one more letter home
I'm going to ask my baby : what's been going on wrong
I'm going to tell my baby : baby I will be home
You better make some arrangements : because it a-won't be very long
I'm going to ask my baby : baby is that your friend
She said now don't you worry : you just walk on in
Now I have acknowledged : baby that I have done you wrong
Now tell me what is the reason : that a-we can't get along

The graveyard is lonely : you better put brakes on yourself
Because that's just where you're going : if I catch you with anyone else
It's a hard pill to swallow : when the neighbors all bring you the news
They say you drinks in the alley : on corners or any place you choose
If you don't treat me no better : I ain't going to be your man no more
I love you it's true : but I will have to let you go
If you don't want to tell your mother : that you soon will be coming home
You better cut out you late hours : and let other mens alone
You drinks way too much whiskey : you ain't got no stopping point
And as soon as all the taverns close : you then head for some moonshine joint

I'm going to leave you baby : out here on the outskirts of town
I brought you out here mama : and you won't stop fooling around
I've cut out my iceman : I bought me a frigidaire
Now you let the serviceman : take you everywhere
I'm going to leave you baby : out here on the outskirts of town
I ain't going to stand nobody : ooo always hanging around
I brought my own groceries : I brought them every day
Now you letting the grocery boy : lay up in the hay
I see you wiggling and giggling : when I'm mad as I can be
Now we got seven children : ain't none of them look like me

Since the hard time is got me : I've been running from door to door
I ain't got no bed to sleep in : I've got to sleep down on the doggone floor
Well it's hard times here : and it's hard times everywhere I go
I've got to make me some money : so I won't have these hard-luck blues no more
You know I used to get me a dollar : before I could catch my breath
But now I ain't got me a dime : unless I toss my poor self to death
Have you ever dreamed you were lucky : and then woke up cold in hand
Well you dreamed you had a dollar : and your woman's got another man

Now tell me baby : how do you want your loving done

Oh roll me on my belly baby : feed me with your chocolate drop

Want you to roll me baby : like the baker rolls his dough

Oh reel and rock me baby : honey if it's all night long

Won't you come back baby : you get me all confused

You can go : you can stay
But you'll come home : some old lonesome day
Some day baby : some old lonesome day
I'm coming home to my baby : some old lonesome day
The Mississippi River : so deep and wide
I can't see my good man : on the other side
I was born in Georgia : but I hangs around Tennessee
I've got a man here in Georgia : partner he's crazy about me
Where were you baby : when that L and N left the shed
You was standing in your back door : with a hung down head

You used to be sweet milk : but you done turned sour on me
If you want me to love you : you hum like a honeybee
Now the old folks shake it : young folks too
Ain't nobody shake it : like my daddy do
Lord the way he shakes it : will make me lose my appetite
And nobody shake it : like papa ??? can
Because the way you shake it : will make me lose my appetite
Because the way you shake it : will make me do things right

I'm a pigmeat mama : pigmeat's all I crave
Pigmeat's going to carry me : carry me to my grave
Some women like their pork chops: some women like their wine
But I'm a pigmeat mama : give it to me all the time
I got pigmeat in Texas : pigmeat in Tennessee
My pigmeat in Virginia : Lord is wild about me
Tell all you women : what you better do
You better lay off my pigmeat : or it won't be good for you
Pigmeat for breakfast : pigmeat when I'm in bed
If I don't get my pigmeat : Lord I'd rather be dead

My man left me : he left me feeling bad
He's the best *kind fellow* : that I ever had
I'm going to send you a ticket : hoping you will come
Come back home : nevermore to roam
If you come back home baby : tell you what I'll do
I'll *teach* my kid-man : how to live true to you
Since you been gone papa : listen what I've done
I've made a lot of money: but I ain't give nobody none
I'll wash you clothes in the morning : bake jellyroll at night
When you come home : that'll be so doggone nice
I drink so much coffee : the grounds are in my *wheeze*
I don't care how I do it : doggone heart disease

Mr gasman : please don't turn off my gas today

But the wind is blowing : and the snow begins to fall

But Mr gasman : these cold winds will really give me a chill

Mr gasman come into my parlor : I want to ask you to close the door

Mr gasman : will you please come around after dark

Are you coming in Mr gasman : I want to tell you something right quick

I want to get you early : and *beat some head cold*

Mr gasman : you got that old hot bankroll right over there in your pants

When you hear me walking : turn your lamp down low
Then turn it so : your man'll never know
Going to buy me a bed : and it shine like a morning sun
When I get to bed : it rock like a Cadillac car
Your head is nappy : your feet so mamlish long
And you move like a turkey : coming through the mamlish corn
I done told you I loved you : what more can I do
And you must a-want me : to lay down and die for you

I'm so lonesome : I'm so lonesome and I'm so blue
I'm so sad and lonesome : mama I don't know what to do
When you have a feeling : that I sure gal don't want no more
You just might as well leave her : even if it hurts you so
I'm going to walk down that dirt road : till somebody lets me ride
If I can't find my baby : I'll run away and hide
I'm going back to Atlanta : down on Decatur Street
If I can't find my baby : I'll be so kind to meet

I got a brown in New York : what I am afraid
If I *just tell her* in her face baby : *that will*

Rocking : rocking myself to sleep
Watching my baby : make that midnight creep
I'm rocking : rocking my worries away
What worries me now : worries me every day
Rocking : rocking on down the road
I'm rocking in places : I never rocked before
Rocking : rocking my blues away
I'm going to rock right here : until the break of day

Listen babe : tell me the truth
Please tell me babe : what you going to do
I love you babe : always treated you kind
But your ways and actions : make me lose my mind
I took you in babe : right off the block
You was beat and raggedy : as a mop
You going to be sorry : you treated me this way
You going to want me babe : I'll be far away
Goodbye babe : I'm leaving you
You haven't did babe : what you should do

I love you baby : ain't going to tell you no lie
Always want you : by my side
Come on baby : let's talk awhile
You know I love you : don't you realize
I'll do anything : just to be with you
Say anything darling : don't say we're through
I love you baby : and you know that's true
What make you do your little mama : like you do
I don't care what they say : I don't care what they do
I'll do anything : in the world for you
Put your arms around me : hold me tight
And love your mama baby : love your mama right

Mmm : oh my mellow man
Can't nobody thrill me : like my mellow man can
He don't stand on no corners : he don't rob and steal
Come home to me : each day to get his meal
Now he ain't no organ grinder : he just nice and sweet
I love that man : from his head down to his feet
My man is so mellow : they call him spongy boy
But that ain't his name : his name is plain Leroy

Listen girls and boys : I've got one stick
Give me a match : and let me take a whiff quick
I started blowing my gauge : and I was having my fun
I spied the police : and I started to run
But the very moment : I looked around
My mind fell ill : throwed that gauge on the ground
I used to didn't blow gauge : drink nothing of the kind
But my man quit me : and that changed my mind
I know to blow this jive : it's a sin and a shame
But it's the only thing : ease my heart about my man

You had plenty of money : in nineteen twenty-two
But you let other women : make a fool of you
Why don't you do right : like some other men do
Get out of here : and get me some money too
You sitting down wondering : what it's all about
If you ain't got no money : they going to put you out
If you had prepared : twenty years ago
You wouldn't have been drifting : from door to door
I fell for your jiving : I took you in
Now all you got to offer me : is a drink of gin

I tried hard : a long time
To get you : to change your mind
You want to know : what it's all about
If you love me : you will soon find out
I work : hard for you
Now tell me daddy : what you going to do
When I see you : walking down the street
I get the thrill : from my head to my feet
It's no use : for us to fuss and fight
We should love some : every night

You got me : feeling sad
The worst feeling : I ever had

I got a man : a real handsome one
He ain't no loafer : he's just a little old country boy
I love him : if he is a little old country boy
Yes I love him : because he fills my heart with joy
Some people say he is lazy : but I know that is a lie
For three years he been doing my work : and I'm perfectly satisfied
I know he will [learn to] love me : when he gets to be a man
Because I'm always going to feed him : right from my hand
Now people all want to know : why do I follow my man
There's no need to explain : because they really wouldn't understand

I'm so sorry you heard : I don't know what to do
I'm sorry for the time : I made you blue

Baby what's the matter : why don't you be yourself
If I didn't love you : I'd get somebody else
But you are so dull and rotten : you think everybody like yourself
If I didn't love you : I'd get somebody else
Because I love you baby : and I want you for myself
If I didn't love you : I would get somebody else
The way you been doing : you know it's wrong
How do you expect : for us to get along
Now maybe some day baby : you'd know for yourself
If I didn't love you : I'd get somebody else

You say I'm a fool : and everyone knows
They wondering why : I don't let you go
Everybody tells me : what he do
But still : I don't believe it's true
You say : he don't treat me right
But he say he love me : both day and night
I'm telling you : right from the start
I don't intend : for us to part
This is all : I have done my best
I love him : and darn the rest

I'm so down-hearted : feeling sad
Baby you left me : sick in bed
Mama and papa told me : when I left my home
I would have to face : the world alone
I keep knocking : but they won't let me in
Because you in there with your new love : drinking your gin
I'm so down-hearted : no place to go
Out in the rain : hail sleet and snow
I'm so down-hearted : everywhere I go
Hard luck and trouble : meets me at the door

My man done quit me : he done throwed me down
I'm sad : because he didn't call around
Did you ever lay down : and dream the whole night long
Dream about your man : and all your ??? *is gone*

Last night I went out alone : I was lonesome as could be
How I longed to find someone : to keep my company
Strange man strange man : let me come close to you
I'm feeling lonely : won't you tell me what to do
I'm looking for someone to love : who can your good gal be
I ain't got nobody : and you sure look good to me

Call me a freakish man : what more was there to do
Just because she said I was strange : that did not make it true
I sent her to the mill : to have her coffee ground
Because my wheel was broke : and my grinder could not be found
You mix ink with water : bound to turn it black
You run around with funny people : you get a streak of it up your back
There was a time when I was alone : my freakish ways to see
But they're so common now : you get one every day in the week
Had a strange feeling this morning : I swear I've had it all day
I'll wake up one of these mornings : that feeling will be here to stay

Now I was just sitting here wondering : where I would go get some ease
Now I'm going back to California : so I can do just as I please
Crossing that old desert mama : just like breaking the Hindenburg Line
Now if you get ditched off on that freight train : you know that will be the end of the line
Oh yes I know I know : oh yes I know
Now the train's at the station : in my mind I'm made up to go
When I reach old Los Angeles California : you ought to hear me jump and shout
Now the people in Los Angeles : they didn't know what it's all about

I feel bluer this morning : than I ever felt before
I'm changing friends and men : and I won't be blue no more
I know you 'buke and dog me : baby with your forty-five
And I couldn't do nothing : but wring my hands and cry
Know you trying to be mean babe : and use me as a child
But it's going to hurt you to your heart : when I leave you for a while

I'm tired of being scolded : when I know I'm doing to best I can
To keep from being your dog daddy : I will get me a brand new man
No use of getting on your knees : because I can't use you no more
I been your dog long enough : so this morning I'll have to go
You know all this time : thinking you was all mine
And I come to find : you was worse all the time
And I didn't say one sentence : till six months after you left
I'll give you one more chance : to make a man out of yourself

Did you ever wake up with the blues : and didn't have no place to go
And you couldn't do nothing : but just walk from door to door
It was late last night mama : and I hear you cry out in bed
I went *over rolled* my baby : and she talked all out of her head
If you don't like my loving : what make you keep on worrying me
Why don't you get you some other man : oh mama and just let me be
Good morning Mr blues : Mr blues I come to talk with you
Mr blues ain't doing nothing : and I would like to get a job from you

I know you like my loving : I can tell from the way you wine
Let you taste my jelly : you just worries me all the time
I told you pretty mama : I have the best jelly in your town
Bet you got a little taste : you just keep on hanging around
I swim deep pretty mama : just like a catfish loaded down
And every time you see me : you wants to fall down on the ground
When me and my baby start to loving : we wants to fight like cats and dogs
But before it's over with : we hollering Lord oh Lordy Lord

Yeah mean mama : where you stay last night
Oh your hair all wrinkled : and your clothes ain't fitting you right
Got up this morning : and I could not keep from crying
Thinking about my rider : she done put me down
The sun going to shine : in my back door some day
I know my woman : going to come my way some day
When I get drunk : well I don't want to drink no more

Listen here : what my dear old mother says
These women and whiskey : going to get my child astray
Easy mama : no good bearing down

Have you ever woke up : with them bullfrogs on your mind

It's going to rain today mama : sun shine in your back door
I'm going to tell you this time mama : I ain't going to tell you no I ain't going to tell you no I mean more
I'm going to tell you this time mama : ain't going to tell you no more
I'm going to leave you partner : and I won't be back here no more
I left you standing here : in your back door crying
I got the bullfrog blues : and I can't be satisfied
Have you ever dreamed lucky : woke up cold in hand

I'm going to tell you : what a Chinaman told a Jew
You don't likee me : well I sure God don't like you
Look a-here partner : see what you done to me

The sun going to shine : in my back door some day

Say it makes no difference : what mama don't allow
We going to have a good time : right anyhow
Well come on daddy : what do you say
Just give me a kiss : that very same way
Well I'm just going to tell you : this one time
Mama this ain't nothing : but to worry your mind
Well it's take me back : try me again
Says I may do better : than what I once have been
Oh come on daddy : this ain't no joke
If you got a good cigarette : just give me a smoke
Take me back : and try me again
Says we'll do better : than what we used to
Well if you don't like my peaches : don't shake my tree
Gal stay out of my orchard : and let my peaches be
Well I tell you buddy : this is a natural fact
Whenever you quit me : I ain't going to take you back

If you just listen closely : tell you just what I mean
I want to tell you : all about my lonesome midnight dream
Something was troubling me last night baby : I swear it was very mean
All night long in my sleep : I felt like I wanted to scream
I would lie down on my bed : I just rolled from side to side
Feel like the girl that I love : have just lay down and died
And I called the undertaker : and the hearse came driving slow
Made me feel so sorry : to see my baby go
Lord I heard a mighty rumbling : just about the dawn of day
It was only the wagon : coming to carry my baby away
When I woke up this morning : folks I just started to scream
Why when I came to find out : that it was just a lonesome midnight dream

Lord I remember : what my big fat mama said
She so big and fat : got to put ashes all in my bed
Now I got rocks all in my pillow : gravel all in my bed
I got morphine in my belly : cocaine in my head
Now if you go : have to bring my good clothes on back
I says go on home mama : you gots: *ruses*  all in your back
Says I been to Montana : been all over Tennessee
Says now tell me what's the reason you get tired of here : baby I been really homesick about you
So true so true Lord : mama so true
Says I seen you leaving last night : baby by the light of the moon
Got three great big bulldogs Lord : to watch you while you sleep
To keep papa's little gold *watch-key* : from doing that 'fore-day creep

So soon this morning mama : you were knocking on my door
Babe you knock : just like you never knocked before
I'm going to tell my baby : what the Chinaman told the Jew
Baby no iggly-oggly me mama : sister no iggly-oggly you

No need to smile mama : don't believe I want no more
Says so cold in China baby : those birds can't hardly sing
Says they don't do nothing : but fly in *frosty* wings
My gal's got a new way : Lord spelling Tennessee
Double S double E : double I double A double L
Lord I'm going I'm going mama Lord : I'm I'm going so far away
Says I'm going too far baby : that you can't hear me say

I woke up this morning : feeling sad and blue
Couldn't find my yo-yo : didn't know what to do
I hurried downtown : called my daddy on the phone
He said don't cry mama : daddy will bring your yo-yo home
If you don't believe I can yo-yo : watch me wind my string
Come home daddy : and make the yo-yo sing
Bring your yo-yo : wind the string around my thumb
I'm an old milkcow : to make the yo-yo mum
If your daddy can't yo-yo : you better learn him how
Listen women : I don't mean to start no row

Hey daddy hey daddy : don't let me cry in vain
You see I'm wounded wounded and bleeding : can't you ease my pain
Hearts is aching day is breaking : listen to me pray
See it's snowing cold wind is blowing : so please be on your way
Mr ambulance man : I can't stay still to save my soul
And you ought to be careful : how you handle my jellyroll

Says people call me Mama Treetop : because I'm slender and tall
But when I get ready : to get my ashes hauled
I got a range in my kitchen : I've got a strict rule
When it gets too hot : I want my oven just cool
You can drink my liquor : where my clothes
But when it comes time : for spending my dough
You can milk my cow : use the cream
But when it comes to loving me : that will be in a dream
You can crank my car : shift my gear
But when any easy riding : goes on here

When I go out singing : I goes out all alone
I got a new way of singing : makes a good woman lose her home
Singing is my trade : I don't have to lie
If you feel my stinger : you want to until you die
It was soon this morning : I heard my doorbell ring
I thought slim was working : and he wasn't doing a doggone thing

Because the women around here : just treat a good man like a dog
I say I'd rather be shaggy : mama just like a dog

You go to your black man mama : I'll stick to my gal

When I had you little black woman : I tried to do the best I could
Now your little daddy's gone : now who you going to get to chop your wood

How come you do me like you do baby : how come you do me like you do
How come you try to make me feel so blue : mama you know I ain't done nothing unto you

You got another big fat man : slam up to my gate
You know you hug and kissed him : said daddy you sure is fat

A nickel is a nickel : a dime is a dime
A woman get tired of one man : all the time
You try to give these women : everything they need
You have to make them : one of your G B V Ds

When I was sick and down : she drove me from her door
I just found out : why my baby treats me so unkind
When she go to bed every night : she tells everything what's on her mind

Baby baby : I am so lonesome for you
Can't wear you off my mind : don't care what I do
When I wake up in the morning : my heart it feels like lead
When I go to bed at midnight : sometimes I wish I was dead
You told me baby : before you left my door
Some day I'd be sorry : that I told you to go
Lord Lord : can't rest no place I go
Blues is driving me crazy : must be reaping what I sow

Let's get our gauge up papa : let our love come down
Get leaping drunk : and leave this lowdown town
Go down on the levee : where the water's high
Let our love come down : till the *cleared outside*

If you quit me daddy : I'm going to leave this town
Can't get my gauge up : and let my love come down

I'm full of mean evil feeling : and I'm full of gin
I'm on my way to the West End : and there's where troubles will begin
They're going to see some shooting : like they've never seen before
I mean my man and my best friend : won't cheat in West End anymore
I got a mean evil feeling : you going to hear bad news
I'm on my way to the West End : to lose those ugly old West End blues

I hate to see : that evening sun go down
Because my daddy : he's done left this town
Feeling tomorrow : just like I feel today
I'm going to pack up my grip : and make my get-away
Oh St Louis women : with their diamond rings
Just pull their men around : by their apron strings
If it weren't for *mortar* : and for store-bought hair
Why the man I love : would not have gone nowhere

You're walking around : no one in sight
Wondering : where your baby is tonight
You're feeling forlorn : you've got the blues
Night and day : you sing those weary tunes
You so down-hearted : you don't know what to do
You ain't got nobody : to tell your troubles to
You're walking for miles : no place to go
You're talking to yourself : Lord but you don't know

Pick me up : don't let me go
Hold me hold me : whisper something sweet and low
Call me lovey : lovey-do
Something sweet : to drive away the blues
Then hold me tight : with all your might
And swear : that you will treat me right
Oh love me : like a caveman does
Because everybody's crazy : about mushy love

Papa papa : let me tell to you
Daddy daddy : here's what you must do
When you come around : sweet precious turtledove
Better come here ready : if you want to win my love
Don't come around : telling me a lot of lies
Because a lying man : I do despise
Papa papa : better do your stuff
Daddy daddy : but don't be too rough
Mama want some loving kisses : right away
Want them when I want them : come on honey don't delay
Don't make me think : you've got a lot of dough
If you ain't got nothing : please tell me so

Now run here pretty mama : tell papa where you been so long
Say you come in here mama : with your clothes on wrong
Says a brownskin gal : make a mule kick his stable down
But a right black gal : make a rabbit move his family to town
Says I went to my gal last night : papa knocked on her door
She said is that you Mr Houndhead : mama can't use you no more
Now woke up this morning : my gal had the worried blues
I looked over in the corner : my poor grandma *what* had them too

The gal I love : she lives on a silver dollar
Every time she leaves me : I declare I'm bound to holler
I don't care who you are : I don't care where you been
Woman on the dollar : that's my best friend
Said she knock and kick me : treat me like a lowdown dirty dog
So I got a pocket full of dollars : huh so you see I ain't on the hog
I got a gal in Alabama : gal in Tennessee
But the gal on the dollar : that's the sweetest baby for me

I feel worried : I feel sad
I lost the best friend : I ever had
Don't care about living : don't want to die
That's the reason : that I hang my head and cry
My man quit me this morning : about the break of day
And he told me : he was going away to stay
He packed his grip up : didn't even say goodbye
When I think of how he left me : I can't help but cry

Woke up this morning gal : 'twixt midnight and day
With my hand around my pillow : where my brownie used to lay
I know I ain't good-looking : teeth don't shine like pearls
So glad : good looks don't take you through this world
Going to starch my jumper mama : iron my overalls
My brown done quit me : God knows she had it all
I'm going to tell you now gal : like Gypsy told the Jew
If you don't want me : it's a cinch I don't want you
Did you ever dream lucky : wake up cold in hand
That's a mighty true sign : your brown got some other man
My mama told me : papa told me too
Some brownskin woman : going to be the death of you

It seems cloudy brown : I believe it's going to rain
Going back to my regular : because she got everything
Hey hey mama : mama that ain't no way to do
You trying to quit me : mama you know I been good to you
Hello Central : give me long long-distant phone
I want to hear : from my sweet mama back home
When your brown [gets, acts] funny : everything you do she gets off
You can hunt you another home : because she don't want you no more

I'm a poor boy : I'm a long way from home
I'm a poor boy : ain't got nowhere to go
Ain't got nowhere : to lay my worried head
Sometime : I'd sooner to be dead
Please tell me : what you going to do

I left my brown : standing in the door
What you reckon she said : you're not obliged to go
I'm a poor boy : stood on the road and cried
I didn't have no blues : just couldn't be satisfied
Now give me : long-distance phone
I want to hear : from my sweet mama back home
I said to her : ring six four nine
I want to hear : from that bobcat gal of mine

Going up to town : what you want me to bring you back
Oh just anything : you think your baby like
Honey honey : you sweet as a plum
Baby you throw your arms around me : let's have some fun
Going up to town : with my hat in my hand
I'm looking for the woman : ain't got no man
Mama mama : just look at sis
Standing on the corner : trying to do the twist
Come here sis : you old stinking sow
You trying to be a woman : and you don't know how
Ain't but two things : I just like
That's salting the dog : and balling the Jack
Wears them in the summer : and she wears them in the fall
Some folks : they don't wear them at all
Honey honey : I'm going to tell you the truth
The day you quit me : that's the day you die

If I mistreat you gal : I sure don't mean no harm
I'm a motherless child : and I don't know right from wrong
Please tell me pretty mama : honey where you stayed last night
You didn't come home : till the sun was shining bright
I have to go so far : to get my hambone boiled
These Atlanta women : going to let my hambone spoil
I done done more for you : than your daddy ever done
I give you my jelly : he ain't give you none
When you see two women : always running hand in hand
You can bet your bottom dollar : one's got the other one's man
I'm going to the river : get me a *dang* old rocking chair
If the blues overtake me : going to rock on away from here

Oh the way my wife treats me : it sure is a sin
Stayed out all night long : before day come creeping in
Then I wanted to know : honey where have you been
She couldn't say nothing : but it'll never happen again
I think sweet mama : I'll have to let you go
So pack up all your clothes : you can't sleep here no more
It's bad to have a crooked woman : she'll keep you living in sin
Then all she will say : it'll never happen again
Now if I had a-listened : to my mama's rule
I wouldn't have been singing : these crooked woman blues
I'm going to sing this verse : and I ain't going to sing no more
I got them blues : and I'm sure Lord got to go

You passed my door brown : you won't even look in
You passed : just like a whirlwind
You can pass me up : try to ignore me too
You like you ignore me : somebody's going to ignore you
I lied down last night : I couldn't even sleep
I thinking about that gal : might make that 'fore-day creep
It's a lowdown fireman : dirty engineer
Done took my gal : and left me standing here
Then I asked the brakeman : let me ride your blinds
Say I'm sorry buddy : but you know this train ain't mine
Some people are happy : and some are burdened down
Some are *so ???ing* : some are so lowdown

Let me in please Charlie : no one here but me
I'm speaking easy : give me a pint of stingaree
Pour me out some white mule : pour me out some sandy rye
I don't want no bug juice : that old stuff is too darn high
Oh liquor liquor liquor : give me liquor until I die
And I'm always happy : when I've got my liquor nigh
I'm kind of worried : got something on my mind
That's why I drink my whiskey : make my faro wait behind
Blind pig blind pig : sure glad you can't see
For if you could : it would be too tight for me
I'm slipping slipping slipping : trying to dodge United States law
I'm loaded down with bootleg : like to make them yammies bawl

So glad I'm brownskin : chocolate to the bone
And I've got what it takes : to make a monkey-man leave his home
Black man is evil : yellow is so lowdown
I walk into these houses : just to see these black men frown
I'm just like Miss Lilliam : I mean Miss Lynn you see
She said a brownskin man : is just all right with me
Yellow man won't quit : black man just won't hey
But a pigmeat mama crazy : about brownskin baby ways
I got a yellow mama : always got a pleasant smile
But that brownskin gal : with her coal-black dreamy eyes

I got them blues : and I can't be satisfied
Got them so bad : I could just lay down and die
Woke up this morning : my clock was striking four
Someone started knocking : knocking on my door
I went to see : what the noise was all about
Someone told me : your brown done left this town
On a Monday morning : first thing sad news
Listen here professor : play for me those blues
Now mama mama : hurry bring it on back to me
You were so crazy : for ever leaving me
Now haven't I done : everything you asked me to
You know by that : I don't love no one but you
Listen here sweet mama : I'm going to tell you a natural fact
You got what I want : so hurry bring it back

Some people want to have plenty of money : some want their wine and song
All I crave is my sweet mama : that I dreams about all night long
Once I had a dear sweet mama : I didn't treat her right
She left this town with a teasing brown : and her name was Mandy White
I'm leaving town : today
When I find that gal : this what I'm going to say
You can have my money : all I want is the facts
I ain't got no time to lose : I got to hurry on back
When I find that aggravated papa : who tried to two-time me
I know I serve a great long sentence : in the penitentiary
I'm going to buy me a gun : airplane and a submarine
I'm going to kill everybody : ever treat me mean

When you were down : sick down on your bed
Know bobby brought you your medicine : also brought you bread
You is up today : looking good again
I knocked on your door : wouldn't even let me in
But the sun going to shine : once more in my back door
It's true I love you sweet mama : but you can't mistreat me no more
I was standing at the terminal : arms fold up and cried
Crying I wonder what train : taking that brown of mine
And I run to the telephone : took the receiver down
I said hello Central : give me Doctor Brown
My baby looks for me : at any old hour at night
No matter when I go there : she's never turning off her light
Mmm : Lord Lord Lord
You womens in Atlanta : treat your men like your dog
Before this time brown : maybe another year
I'll be up the country : drinking that cool can beer

How long how long : how long my train been gone
Been gone long enough : to take you to your good gal home
Tell my wild women in California : where I so long to be
Wild women and whiskey : can make a fool out of me
They can lead me like a little airedale : that's only seven weeks old
They can lead me to the water : shake my head no no no
The longest train I ever rode : was seventy-nine coaches long
But if the man had a-seed me : around the mountain I'd have been gone
I was on my way to California : where I so long to be
Honey I'm from Missouri : you have to *side* me

I caught a pretty little animal : it was striped black and white
What it done to me : spoiled me the rest of my life
I thought it was a squirrel : I took him into my camp
When I put him down : all my clothes was damp
All the people around me : they give me plenty of air
It was so doggone strong : I sniffled it everywhere
I never smelled a smell : that smelled so doggone bad
It was the worst old smell : baby I ever had
I jumped into the water : I scrubbed scrubbed scrubbed scrubbed
But I smelled stronger : baby the harder I rubbed
It was a doggone polecat : and he [sure] ain't no friend of mine
He as pretty as a white dog : but he ain't worth a doggone dime

Said come along mama : give me a hug
You got the world : I got the stopper and the jug
Gals all call me : big bad Pete
But they crazy : about this little pigmeat
Skinny gal in the summer : may be all right
But a fat gal in the winter : just too tight
My gal she's easy : some say she's slow
There's things about her : you don't know
Listen to me : please listen to my song
Take it slow and easy : you bound to get along
Me and my gal : was side by side
She said daddy : I would like to ride

When I'm in my whiskey : I don't care what I say
Because me and my whiskey : we going to have our way
Please tell me mama : what kind of loving you crave
I got the *kind that know about* : seven different ways
I'm down in Atlanta : where the womens they all know me
I'm going up to Detroit : give me you gal you ain't *seen*
Don't you never : want new loving sometimes
They moves it a little different : but it's all the same old kind
Don't let your gal fix you : like my gal fixed me
She made me love her : now she's way down in Tennessee
Wild women out west : where I so long to be
Wild women and whiskey : can make a fool out of me

Let me be your little dog : until your big hound comes
I can do more howling : than your big dog ever done
Look over your role books : see if you got my baby's name
She's acting funny : and I she don't seem the same
Take care of the baby : because she'll a broad some day
And if I'm not too busy : I'll be stopping by your way
I feel like falling : from the treetop to the ground
My girl got a mean joker : and a-he don't allow me around
I go there early in the morning : and I'll go there late at night
She used to be my sugar : now he ain't treating her right
You got to love your baby : so she'll stay home at night
And if you don't love her : she sure ain't going to treat you right
You can't love me baby : and love my brother too
Because that's that's something : it will never do

Twenty mens after the same job : all in the same old day
Hard times hard times : we [sure] got hard times now
Just drink and think about it : we got hard times now

Be careful with yourself : you'll get a ball and chain

And after election was over : your head's down like a billygoat

Up said the spider : to the little fly one day
Won't you come around : let's pass the time away
Come into my parlor : said the spider to the fly
You won't have to do no hollering : I love you until you die
My mama told me be careful : wherever I flew
Spider's will try to tempt you : and be *baby*
I think it would be a treat : just for you and I
To order in some quince meat : and get all ???fied
Come into my parlor : said the spider to the fly
I'll give you loving : loving until you die

Oh nobody knows : Atlanta like I do
But the reason I know it : I traveled it through and through
If you got a good woman : here's the lesson I'll give to you
Don't you take her to Atlanta : the men will take her away from you
Lord they taken my woman : hurt me to the bone
That's the reason why : you hear me cry and moan
I taken one woman : believe me I am through
Just for what you do : it coming home to you
Oh don't you hear : that steamboat whistle blow
And it blows just like : it never blowed before
That's all right baby : about how you run around
But you had to face sorrow : when Bob gets back in town
If you take my woman : I won't get mad with you
Like you take her from me : somebody sure take her from you

You do that scraunch : and it's just too tight
I've got a gal : by the name of Blind Lemon Mack
She do that scraunch : it's good like that

I ain't going to marry : ain't going to settle down
I'll keep on drinking : keep on running around
The mouse got the measles : the dog's got the whooping cough
Doggone any man : lets a woman be his boss
The womens don't like me : because I speak my mind
But the men call mama : because I take my time
I ain't good-looking : and I ain't long and tall
Don't believe I'm a donkey : put me in a stall

Papa papa : something's going on wrong
If I catch you stealing : regret the day you's born
When daddy gets his razor : babies in the cradle moan
Because they lost their mama : he's got them all alone
Nobody knows : what the sheik will do
They'll spend all their money : leave you sad and blue
I'm going to quit my kid-man : I like my used-to-be
My kid-man don't want nobody : to talk to me

Dying for some loving : and the one you love has gone

Lonesome and lovesick : baby just for you

Cuckoo was howling : sun was almost down
Then I got to go through Death Valley : there ain't a house for twenty-five miles around
My poor feet is so tired : Lord help me some way
Then I got three hundred miles to go : traveling through the mud and clay

Ella Ella : down on my bended knees

You know I love my baby : that's why we can't get along
Looks like everything I do : something going on wrong

Got to get on that train : I said I'd even brought my trunk
Boys if you have been running around in this world : this train will wreck your mind
Lord I once was a hobo : I crossed so many *points*
But I decided to pull down for a fast life : and take it as it comes
There's so many people : have gone down today
And these fast trains north and south : have settled their lives in clay
I said look here engineer : can I ride your train
He said look you ought to know this train ain't mine : and you asking me in vain
Said if you go to the Western Union : you might get a chance
You might to wire to some of your people : and your fare will be sent right here
I want to go home : and this train is done gone dead

Had a dream last night : that the man I love was dead
Went to the graveyard : fell down on my knees
And I asked the gravedigger : to give me back my good man please
The gravedigger : looked me in the eye
Says I'm sorry lady : but your man has said his last goodbye
I wrung my hands : and I wanted to scream
But when I woke up : I found it was only a dream

Way down : below the Mason-Dixon line
That's where I'm going : just to ease my mind
Want to see my folks : I miss them so

Won't I be glad : when my train pulls in
See my mammy : and my Uncle Ben
This northern country : it make you choose
But it will never cure : the Mason-Dixon blues

Good old gal : got to lay there till Judgment Day
Oh my woman's so black : she stays apart of this town
Can't nothing go : when the poor gal is around
Oh some people tell me : the worried blues ain't bad
It's the worst old feeling : that I ever had
Mmm I fold my arms : and I walked away
That's all right mama : your troubles will come some day

Oh I'm going to get me religion : I'm going to join the Baptist Church
I'm going to be a Baptist preacher : and I sure won't have to work
Oh I'm going to preach these blues now : and I want everybody to shout
I'm going to do like a prisoner : I'm going to roll my time on out
Oh up in my room : I bowed down to pray
Say the blues come along : and they drove my spirit away
Oh and I had religion : Lord this very day
But the womens and whiskey : well they would not let me pray
Oh I wish I had me : a heaven of my own
Then I'd give all my women : a long long happy home
Yeah I love my baby : just like I love myself
Well if she don't have me : she won't have nobody else

Hey I'm going to fold my arms : I'm going to kneel down in prayer
When I get up : I'm going to see if my preaching suit a man's ear
Now I met the blues this morning : walking just like a man
I said good morning blues : now give me your right hand
Now it ain't nothing now baby : Lord that's going to worry my mind
Oh I'm satisfied : I got the longest line
Oh I got to stay on the job : I ain't got no time to lose
I swear to God : I got to preach these gospel blues
Oh I'm going to preach these blues : and choose my seat and sit down
When the spirit comes sisters : I want you to jump straight up and down

The dry spell blues have fallen : drive me from door to door
The dry spell blues : have put everybody on the killing flood
Now the people down south : sure won't have no home
Because the dry spell : have parched all this cotton and corn
Hard luck's on everybody : and many people are blue
Now besides the shower : ain't got no help for you
Lord I fold my arms : and I walked away
Just like I tell you : somebody's got to pay
Pork chops forty-five cents a pound : cotton is only ten
I can't keep no woman : no no nowhere I been
So dry : old boll weevil turned up his toes and died
Now ain't nothing to do : bootleg moonshine and rye

It have been so dry : you can make a powderhouse out of the world
Then all the moneymen : like a rattlesnake in his coil
I done throwed up my hands : Lord and solemnly swore
There ain't no need of me changing towns : it's a drought everywhere I go
It's a dry old spell : everywhere I been
I believe to my soul : this old world is about to end
Well I stood in my back yard : wrung my hands and screamed
And I couldn't see nothing : couldn't see nothing green
Oh Lord : have mercy if you please
Let your rain come down : and give our poor hearts ease
These blues these blues : is worthwhile to be heard
For it's very likely : bound to rain somewhere

Woke up this morning : about five o'clock
Get me some eggs : and a nice pork chop
Cheap cigar : and a magazine
Had to run through the street : to catch the five-fifteen
Let me tell you something : that I seen
Coalman got run over : by the five-fifteen
Cut off his arms : and it cracked his ribs
Did the poor man die : no the poor man lived
Let me tell you something : that I know
Coalman got run over : by the five forty-four
Cut off his arms : and it crunched his head
The poor man died : no the poor man lived
I ain't got : but a little bit left
If you don't come and get it : I'm going to burn it myself
Get the wood in the stove : and the match in your hand
You run to the door : and stop the *dirty* coalman
Sell it to the rich : and I sell it to the poor
Sell it to the nice brown : a-standing in the door
Furnish you wood : furnish you coal
Make you love me : doggone your soul
I got your water : got you gas
You treat me mama : says that's your last
Let me tell you mama : what's the matter now
You don't want me : take me anyhow
Sweet mama sweet mama : what's on your mind
Say you can't quit me : no need of trying
I'm going up the country : don't you want to go
Leaving here : ain't coming back no more
Me and my rider : and two or three more
We're going up the country : don't you want to go
Went down the road : feeling bad
I feel so worried : that I ever had
Don't believe I'm leaving : count the day I'm gone

I'm going to Tishamingo : because I'm sad today
Say the woman I love : she done drove me away
I'm going to Tishamingo : to have my hambone boiled
These Atlanta women : done let my hambone spoil
I woke up this morning : between midnight and day
I felt for my rider : she done walked away
Can't you always tell : when your good gal going to treat you mean
You meals is unregular : you house ain't never clean
You can always tell : that something going on wrong
When you come in : your rider she's out and gone
Say when she come in : she got a rag tied around her head
You speak about loving : she swear she's almost dead
Sweet mama : what's on your loving mind
You can't quit me : 'tain't no need of trying
I got a loving faro : she's long and tall like me
I love my brownskin : don't care where she be

Grab your gal : fall in line
While I play : this rag of mine
Too tight : it won't *don*
Too tight : it'll make you warm
Too tight : ain't it a shame
Too tight : shaking that thing
Too tight : hear me cry
Too tight : just don't die
Too tight :

Too tight : give it the gate
Too tight : let's don't wait
Too tight : you hear me say
Too tight : it make us afraid

Take me sweet mama : allow me one more show
I swear to the Lord : that I won't do wrong no more
I don't love no woman : if she ain't got baby ways
I'm crazy about my loving : it's always been my crave
I hung my head : I cried just like a child
Said the way I'm treated mama : I sure ain't satisfied
If you ever go to Memphis : stop by Jessie's hall
You'll see my picture : hanging on the wall
I got the blues so bad : mama my poor heart is sore
Can't rest contented : nowhere I go
Take me mama : please don't throw me down
I'm going to pack my suitcase : I'm going to blow this town

When I ??? game last night : thought I'd have some fun
Lost all the money that I had baby : pawned my special gun
Says I gambled all over Missouri : gambled all through Spain
Police come to arrest me babe : and they did not know my name
Gambled all over Missouri : gambled through Tennessee
Soon as I reach old Georgia : the niggers carried a handcuff to me

Been begging you : all night long
I'll acknowledge : I done wrong
Begging you : down on my knees
Begging you : babe if you please

Just a worried old rounder : with a troublesome mind
All bundled up from hardship : fate to me have been unkind
I wouldn't listen to my mother : wouldn't listen to my dad
And by my reckless living : I've put myself in bad
I ain't trusting nobody : I'm afraid of myself
I've been too lowdown : life have put me on the shelf
My friends have turned against me : smiling in my face
Since I been so disobedient : I must travel in disgrace
I cannot shun the devil : he stay right by my side
There is no way to cheat him : I'm so dissatisfied
Ain't nobody wants me : they wouldn't be in my shoes
I feel so disgusted : I've got them lowdown rounder blues

I'm laying in jail : my back turned to the wall
Says a Georgia woman : was the cause of it all
They arrested me : carried me before the judge
Say the judge wouldn't like me : and he say a mumbling word
I asked the judge : what might be my fine
Get a pick and shovel : dig down in the mine
I told the judge : I ain't been here before
If you give me light sentence : I won't come here no more
Mr judge Mr judge : please don't break so hard
I always been a poor boy : never hurt no John
So the next day : they carried the poor boy away
Said the next day : I *led* a ball and chain
Take the stripes off my back : chains from around my legs
This ball and chain : about to kill me dead

Standing in the station : waiting for my train

Took my gun : and I broke the barrel down
Put my baby : six feet under the ground

You got the blues : and still ain't satisfied

Standing on the mountain : far as I can see
Dark clouds above me : clouds all around poor me
Feeling low and weary : Lord I've got a trouble in mind
Everything that gets me : everybody's so unkind
Harvest time's coming : and will catch me unprepared
Haven't made a dollar : bad luck is all I've had

Get away from my window : honey babe get away from my door

Honey babe honey babe : why don't you tell me what you're going to do

You can iron my shirts : you can bless my soul

Says it ain't but the one thing : that grieve my mind
All these women : and none is mine
Says a little fish big fish : swimming in the water
Come on back here man : and give me my quarter
It's like hunting for a needle : in a bed of sand
Trying to find a woman : haven't got no man
Three barrels of your whiskey : four barrels of gin
Says I have a papa home : and you can't come in
Says God made a woman : and he made her mighty funny
Kiss her on the mouth : just sweet as any honey

But my chief occupation : taking women from their monkey-men
Says I ain't good-looking : my teeth don't shine like pearls
But I've got something babe : to carry me through this big darn world
Now I think I heard a rumbling : deep down in the ground
Well it must have been the devil : chaining my good gal down
Now the men don't like me : just because I speak my mind
But the women cry papa : just because I take my time

Because ever gets broke : I'll be able to use it
Now when you're laying in jail : with your head in your arms
And then you realize : your sweet mama's gone

Now I'm going away : to wear you off my mind
You keep me broken-hearted : mama all the time
Now here's one thing : I can't understand
A good-looking woman : likes a workingman
Now I don't see how : you *honky* women can *pace*
Shimmy all day : without a bite to eat
Now if it wasn't for the powder : store-bought hair
State Street women : couldn't go nowhere
Now I went to the show : the other night
The people on State Street : trying to fight
I ain't crazy about my brown : or about my brown
You can't tell the difference : when the sun go down
When you see two women : running hand by hand
You bet your bottom dollar : she's got the other one's man
Now run here mama : stay back in my home
If your man catch you : I don't mean no harm

You can always tell : when your good gal don't want to be seen
Because your meals ain't ready : the house is never clean
Just like hunting for a needle : buried in a bed of sand
That is to find a woman : haven't got no man
Three barrels of whiskey : mama four barrels of gin
She said the *headknots* at home : daddy and you can't in
It was early one morning : just at the close of four
When Dolly Smith : knocked on Evelyn's door
She jumped up sweet babe : tipped on across the floor
Hollering long tall daddy : don't you knock no more
It was in the loving kitchen : where they made the plot
For to poison her father and her mother : in the coffeepot
Then they carried the remains : throwed it out in the *shore*
Killed fifteen chickens :
Policeman said to Freddie : what do you know about this
Says I guess : you'll have to go arrest poor Dolly Smith
Then they carried poor dolly : put her behind the bar
Give him thirty-nine days : mama and that ain't all
Poor evelyn's in jail : with her back turned to the wall
Hollering cool kind daddy : you know you the cause it all
I'm going to sing this time : ain't going to sing no more
Because my throat's got dry : swear my tonsil's sore

Now down in Georgia : they got a dance that's new
There ain't nothing to it : it is easy to do
Now it ain't no Charleston : ain't no buck and wing

Can your sweet papa stop by here : or must I pass on by
I got the faking blues : going to sing them anywhere I please
That's the reason why : give my poor heart some ease
Lord I'm going away mama : believe me it ain't stall
Because I can get more women : than a passenger can haul
Lord I'm going to the nation : buy me an Indian squaw
I'm going to raise me a family : got me an Indian ma
I got the faking blues : sing them anywhere I go
Tell you the reason I sing them : my sweet mama don't love me no more
Lord I went to the river : looking for a place to set down
I thought about my faking jellyroll : come on back to town

Stood on the corner : feet got soaking wet
I was hollering and crying to every brown : to hell I'm at
I'm Alabama bound : I'm Alabama bound
Then if you want me to love you babe : you got to leave this town
When the rooster crowed : the hen looked around
Said if you want me to love you babe : you got to run me down
Look here pretty mama : who can your regular be
Says the reason I'm *blacking out stalling* babe : you been so good to me
There's a preacher in the pulpit : Bible in his hand
And the sisters was back in the amen corner : hollering that's my man

But she's *way on south* now darling babe : Alabama bound
Just like a beefsteak beefsteak : ain't got no bone
Then if a man like a good brownskin woman now babe : he ain't got no home
Elder Green's in town : and he's going around
And he's telling all the sisters and the brothers he meets : he's Alabama bound
Now don't you leave me here : don't you leave me here
Just before you and your partner get ready to go : leave a dime for beer

Now I got a gal : works in the yard
She brings me meat : she brings me lard
Only thing : that keep me barred
People she works for : don't allow me in the yard
Going to tell you one thing : it's a natural fact
Want you to come on home : and drop that sack
Now I got a gal : she lives on the hill
Took our corn : to the sugar mill
Still I know : I wouldn't take no salt
I'll grind your corn : into sweet jellyroll
I asked for one : she brought me two
Down to the crap game : me and you
Got two dollars : my point was nine
Police come a-running : and the *chips* went flying
Said I went to the Gypsy : to get me a hand
See my gal walking : with another man
I said you may go : you'll come back
If you ever come back : you got to drop that sack

I ain't good-looking : and I don't dress cute
But I just want to *break* : some good man's *opportune*
I ain't no race horse : I ain't built for speed
But I got everything : that a race horse papa needs
You may fall from the mountain : down in the deep blue sea
You ain't done no falling : till you fall in love with me
I ain't no coalman : ain't no coalman's son
But I can keep you warm : until your coalman comes
Won't you tell me pretty mama : I won't have to wait
Will I be your regular : or did I come too late
I may look green : but I ain't no clown
I'm just a red-hot papa : just blowed in your town

Take me back baby : you know I don't know my mind
For when I'm mistreating you : I'm loving you all the time
I walked the streets all day : hung my head and cried
I laid awake all night : trying to make myself satisfied
There's one thing honey : I want you to understand
That's your time ain't long : if I catch you with another man
You ain't good-looking : and you don't dress fine
But there ain't no reason : let some other man read my sign
Going down to the river : honey don't you wear no black
Because when you think I'm gone : I'll come creeping back
If you don't want me : why don't you tell me why
Because you flirting with the undertaker : I mean it ain't no lie

She's short and squatty : she's all right with me
Now knock-kneed mama : what you going to cook tonight

Teach my mama : that washboard rub
Now some people say : chitlings are good to eat

You can't switch your tail : like I switch mine

I was walking down Morgan : stopped on Maxwell Street
I asked the desk sergeant ??? police force : my gal ain't off of the street
I couldn't talk to the desk sergeant : tell him *when and* where it took place
Because I knew my mama : got arrested on Maxwell Street
Lord I'm talking about the wagon : talking about the ??? car too
Because Maxwell Street's so crowded on a Sunday : you can hardly pass through
There's Maxwell Street Market : got Water Street Market too
If you ain't got no money : the women got nothing for you to do
I got the Maxwell Street blues : mama and it just won't pay
Because the Maxwell Street women : going to carry me to my grave
I live six twenty-four Maxwell : mama and I'm talking about you
Because I swear I don't walk : said Buly Buly Buly how do you

That's the last time : don't you boil them rice
You can brown your gravy : fry your steak
Sweet mama : don't make no mistake
Just sure as the winter : follows the fall
There ain't no one woman : got it all
You can meet a woman : that you can't understand
Must be looking for you : or a monkey-man
Now cool kind mama : says you needn't've stalled
Throw it out the window : I'll catch it before it falls
I got the blues so bad : I couldn't sleep last night
My cool kind mama : want to fuss and fight

To get a flying start : and run my baby down

If brownskin's the best : I'll *play a teasing brown*
Oh feel like a dirty : feel like a dat dat dat
Doesn't somebody know : where my baby at
I'm going to grab me a train : beat it on up the line
I'm going to ride : until I find that good-goody woman of mine

Everybody's talking : about the *gren??? day*
I got one : with the sweetest ways
Your baby : can roll her jelly fine
Nobody's baby : can roll it like mine
Your baby : ain't sweet like mine
She bake her jellyroll : all the time
And when I'm feeling : lonesome and blue
My baby : know just what to do
Never has a baby : put me outdoor
She even buys me : all my clothes
I don't want to brag : just want to put you in line
Your baby : ain't sweet like mine

Tell me tell me : please has anybody seen my brown
She used to love me : till old fatmouth blew in town
She's a long tall woman : with coal-black curly hair
With one gold tooth : then you'll know her anywhere
She used to be mine : but the fatmouth has got her now
That's a dirty mistreater : didn't mean me no good nohow
I'm going to love you mama : till my whiskers pass the ground
When you die : I'm going to keep on hanging around
I bought all her clothes : I bought her a diamond ring
Then along come a fatmouth : keep me shaking that thing

It was early one morning : just about the break of day
Says I thought I heard : my sweet baby say
You can read a newspaper : you can't read a person's mind
But when you think she's loving you : dropping you all the time
Now baby you can tell me : just what are you to do
Now I believe I'll go back : to my old-time used-to-be
She's long and she's tall : she's shaped just like a willow tree
And the reason I love her : says she belongs to me

I get up early in the morning : sweet mama and I comb and curry my horse
Because I don't want nobody : not to *see my pause*
Then I goed up to the coal pile : get me a friend to buy some coal
Then I get on my wagon : *then I'm a coal-traveling snow*
*I ought to tell how much* for coal : thirty-five cents a bag
And if you want to know my name : just look around on my sack
I got on my wagon : trying my best to sell my coal
My baby's back home : serving my jellyroll
Now a lot of your women : ought to be put in jail
Some standing on the corner : trying to get themselves in jail

Now I got a lady : by the name of Sue
She'd like to know : just what to do
Now when you what it : I agree
Don't forget : to ask for me
Now she's a woman : hard to beat
All you got to do is dance : and stay on your feet
Now you ain't good-looking : you don't dress cute
You got to keep a papa : for your personal use
Now January February : and March too
The women come along : and showed her just what to do
Now a woman needn't think : she got a man by herself
A man needn't think : he got a woman by himself
Now tain't but one thing : that grieve my mind
All these brownskins : none of them mine

I know a man : he's on our street
He don't do nothing : but eat and sleep
Now he's a man : that I would love to meet
He's always dressed up : and out in the street
Now he don't drink whiskey : nothing sweet
When it comes to pretty women : he sure loves to meet
*I'm hot as the devil* : *I walk about the street*
All that ??? : to the sweet man's *feet*
Now he's a man : has a *copper* good to eat
He always looks good : from his head to his feet
Now when he walks into a place : and takes his seat
His ways and actions : is hard to beat

I ain't talking to one : I ain't talking to two
I'm talking to the captain : and the whole doggone crew
Yes she smokes the cigarettes : throws ashes in the tray
She's a good woman : she likes to have her way
I'm going away : won't be long
You look for me : I'll be gone

Ain't nothing in the jungle : that's any better than me
I'm the baddest man : ever came from Tennessee
I slept with a panther : until just about the break of day
I grabbed the wildcat in the collar : and asked the tiger what he had to say
I wear a scorpion for my watch fob : a rattlesnake for my chain
I scares a gorilla : and make him change his big ugly name
I make a *sea tick* catch a freight train : I make a flea grab the mail
I make a jumbo elephant : grab an airplane and sail
I was traveling in a rowboat : drifting out in the sea
I made a sea lion cub come back : and shake glad hands with me
Way down in the forest : there's where I long to be
Because ain't nothing in the jungle : that's any better than me

Now you know baby : you know it's true
I don't love : no one but you
I'm going to tell you : just before we start
All I want you to do : is to lone me your heart
I'm going to ask you : now baby before you start
All you got to do : is to lone me your heart

This corn liquor ??? : there's plenty more to be made
Just get a job at one of these stills : and you surely will be paid
I tell you it's a mighty risk to run : and a mighty chance to take
To spend your money : for the corn that the bootlegger makes
When the bootlegger goes to his still : get ready to make his stuff
He got his concentrated lye : cocaine and his snuff
I went home the other night : I swore I wouldn't drink no more
Until saloons come back with bottle and *bondy* : in the days of long ago
But I see that will never be : so I just got drunk again
I haven't nothing so long as corn liquor lasts : and I got no money to spend

I'm going to tell the sergeant : *he the* chief of police
The women around here : won't let me see no peace
Because I'm wild about my loving : and I like to have my fun
You want to be a girl of mine baby : bring me whiskey when you come
Hello Central : what's the matter with your line
I want to talk : to that high brown of mine
I don't want no sugar : stirred up in my tea
Because the girl I want : is sweet enough for me
I ain't no iceman : no iceman's son
But I can keep you cool : till the iceman comes
I ain't no fireman : and no fireman's son
But I can keep you warm : until the fireman comes
I'm going to tell you people : to listen to this song
I'm going to see my gal : and it won't be long

Oh how she loved to dance : that old grizzly bear
I guess she's gone to Frisco : to dance it there
Always a sign : everybody know you through
The more you do for people : the less they think of you

Oh how she loved to dance : that old grizzly bear
I guess she's gone to Frisco : to dance it there
It's always a sign : everybody knows it's true
The more you do for people : the less they they think of you

Hello Central : what's the matter with your line
I want to talk : to that high brown of mine
I'm going to the river : with a rope and a rock
And the way you treat me : I'm going to jump over the dock
Tell me how long : will I have to wait
Can I get you now : or must I hesitate
I'm got something to tell you : and I know it ain't good news
Because a hesitating woman : give me the hesitation blues
I'm going to tell the sergeant : and the see the chief police
Because the women around here : won't let me see no peace
I've got a girl in Memphis : she's all right
But the girl in Cincinnati : is just too tight
I'm got a girl in Cairo : loves me I know
But the gal in Louisville : has got the best *clothes*
My mother says I'm wicked : daddy says I'm wild
I know I ain't good-looking : but some woman's angel child
I'll sing you these verses : and it didn't take long
If you want to hear any more : you'll have to buy this song

Well I hates to see : that evening sun go down
Because it makes me think : about my last go-round
It I'm feeling tomorrow : a-like I feel today
I'm going to pack my suitcase : and make my long get-away
Because the St Louis woman : she wears a diamond ring
She leads a man around : by her apron string
If it wasn't for powder : and this store-bought hair
Oh the girl I love : wouldn't go nowhere
A redheaded woman : make a freight train jump the track
And a black-headed girl : will make a preacher ball the jack

I'm a poor coal loader : I'm in the mine
Slave for my woman : till I'm almost blind
I work so hard : from dawn to dusk
Can't find a woman : that I can trust
I work so : from six to six
Kid-man wait : to get his business fixed
I work every day : in the mine
Come home at night : you got my best friend crying
The food you cook : a hound dog sick
Woman I swear : you's a no-good chick

Ah wake up mama : wake up and don't sleep so sound
Give me what you promised me : before you lay down
I said get my tuni : only thing I love
Make you weep like a willow : sling snot like a turtledove
Now I've got a gal : and the kid live out on the hill
She got good doing : serve to the one she may will
She got good tuni : I'm a fool about my yam yam yam
Get my yam yam yam : I'm going back to Alabam'
Now come in here baby : and sit down in my lap
Sit one side : I forgot to tell you I had the
Clap your hands Charlie : Charlie where's you been so long
I been down in Tennessee : and I couldn't stay there very long
I got a job in the freight house : trying to learn how to truck
A box fell on me this morning : like to bust one of my
Nuthouse for crazy folks : folks got sense don't go there
And all the friends I had : done shook hands and left there
I got a gal : and the kid playing deaf and dumb
But the movements in her hip : will make a dead man
Come on out my window : don't knock on my door
And I told you two or three times : don't want you no more
Now run in here baby : because I done got kind of sick
It ain't nothing ailing my stomach : it's something wrong with my
Dixieland was a camp in Georgia : you can't stay there very long
All the friends I had : done shook hands and gone
Now here's a verse : I don't want a soul to miss
I been taking charity grub : I've got to go outside
Shut your mouth boy : four boys can't talk at once
And I done told you two or three times : I don't want no junk

I heard the people say : Casey Jones can't run
I'm going to tell you : what the poor boy done
Left Cincinnati : about half past nine
Got to Newport News : before dinner time
Now Casey Jones said : before he died
He fixed the road : so a bum could ride
And if he ride : he have to ride the rod
Rest his heart : in the hand of God
Now little girl says : mama is that a fact
Papa got killed : on the I C track
Yes yes honey : but hold your breath
Get that money : from your daddy's death
When the news reached town : Casey Jones was dead
Women went home : and *had it* out in red
Slipping and sliding : all across the streets
With their loose mother hubbard : and their stocking feet
Now Casey Jones : went from place to place
Another train hit his train : right in the face
People got off : but Casey Jones stayed on
Natural policeman : but he dead and gone
Here come the biggest boy : coming right from school
Hollering and crying : like a doggone fool
Look here mama : is our papa dead
Womens going home : and *had it* out in red
*Low cut* shoes : and their evening gowns
Following papa : to the burying ground
Now tell the truth mama : he say is that a fact
Papa got killed : on the I C track
Quit crying boy : don't do that
You got another daddy : on the same damn track

You hear me talking to you : did you hear what I say
Lord today has been : a long old lonesome day
And now my rider : eee Lord will be the same old way
I've been to the nation : around the territor'
You hear me talking to you : you got to reap what you sow
I've been all through the nation : and around the territor'
But I found no heaven on earth : Lord nowhere I go
I'm going to the big house : and I don't even care
Don't you hear me talking to you : I'm scolding to my dear
I'm going in the morning : and I don't even care
I might get four or five years : Lord I might get the chair
Oh stop and listen : see tomorrow bring
You hear me talking to you : start to playing
You better stop now and listen : and see what tomorrow brings
It might bring you sunshine : Lord and it may bring rain
Some got six months : some got a solid year
You hear me talking to you : buddy what made you stop by here
Some of them got six months partner : and some got a solid year
But I believe my partner : Lord got a lifetime here

I'd rather be the devil : to be that woman's man

Oh nothing but the devil : changed my baby's mind

I laid down last night : tried to take my rest
My mind got to rambling : like the wild geese from the west
The woman I love Lord : stoled her from my best friend
But he got lucky : stoled her back again

I would rather be buried : in some cypress grove
To have some woman : Lord I can't control
And I'm going away now : I'm going away to stay
That'll be all right pretty mama : you going to need my help some day
Well the sun going down : and you know what you promised me
And what's the matter : baby I can't see
I would rather be dead : and six feet in my grave
To be way up here honey : treated this a-way
Well the old people told me : baby but I never did know
The Good Book declares : we got to reap just what we sow
When your knee bones aching : and your body cold
Well you just getting ready : honey for the cypress grove

I love my cherry ball : better than I love myself
She gets so she don't love me : she won't love nobody else
Cherry ball quit me : she quit me in a calm good way
Lordy what to take to get her : I carries it every day
Sure as that spider : hanging on the wall
I warned little old cherry ball : she was *falling out cold*
I'll catch the Southern : and she'll take the Santa Fe
I'm going to ride and ramble : till cherry come back to me

Hard times here : everywhere you go
Times is harder : than ever been before

You talk about your forty-four forty : buddy it'll do very well
But my twenty-two twenty : Lord is a burning hell
Now that thirty-eight special : buddy it's most too light
But my twenty-two twenty : make the *camp* go right

I'm going to beat some dirt : and it won't take long
Well they cool it on State Street : warm it down the line
You ought to hear the frogs on Durban : singing and crying
Now the folks down east : are crying Lord Lord Lord
Gang in the west : say the cops is so hard
Well I went down to Michigan : came up Grant
Saw the sweetbacks and the strutters : all raising sand
I went to a good-time flat : last Saturday night
The cops knocked on the door : everybody made their flight
I met myself a good gal : she said she was fifty-one
She started to loving and squeezing : I thought she say son you just begun
Now a yellow gal is like a frigid zone : brownskin's about the same
You want some good loving : get yourself an old Crow Jane
Now I ain't no janitor : no fireman's son
But I can keep your boiler hot : till the superintendent come

Come on and let me know : who you are
Do that dance : called the *don't be long*
Do the Mississippi : and the Mobile Bay
Turn right around : go the other way
Put your hands on your hips : and let your mind move on
Holler like you did : the first day you was born
Do the black snake wriggle : and the frog hop
Take it to the attic : if it gets too hot
Now old sister Sue : *got* heavy a load
She likes to do it : because she got kind of cold
*Hatsie Gray* : and old friend Lou
Some day : this thing's going to happen to you

I've got a gal : she's low and squatty
I mean boys : she'll suit anybody
Last night : she loved me for a while
You could hear me holler : mmm for a while
Sometimes she makes me sneeze : sometimes she makes me cough
Lord you ought to see her : when she starting me off
Last night : while I was sound asleep
I felt a funny feeling : from my head to my feet
She was born in Kentucky : raised in Tennessee
Came all the way from Dixie : to put that thing on me

Ain't you getting tired : of [trying to cheat, cheating] on your papa hon'
Corrine : you the meanest gal I ever seen
Corrine : she just about five feet tall
She sleeps in the kitchen : one foot in the hall
I've got a corrine in Texas : sure can bring me down
Got a corrine in Harlem : make a rabbit hug a hound

I walked from Dallas : I walked to Wichita Falls
After I lost my sugar : I wasn't going to walk at all
Women see you coming : they go get their rocking chair
I want to fools this man : and make out he's welcome here
So cold in China : this voice can't hardly sing
You didn't make me mad : till you broke my diamond ring
I'm going to grab my sugar : papa don't care what you do

When she gets a letter from Lemon : I wrote her two days out
Tell me what's the matter : [papa Lemon, I] can't get no mail
Mama said last night : don't let a black cat cross your trail
I got up this morning : the blues all around my bed
Went in to eat my breakfast : and the blues all in my bread

Well the blues come to Texas : loping like a mule
You take a high brown woman : man she's hard to fool
You can't never tell : what a woman's got on her mind
You might think she's crazy about you : but she leaving you all the time
Ain't so good-looking : your teeth don't shine like pearls
But that nice disposition : carry a woman all through the world
I'm going to the river : going to carry my rocking chair
Going to ask that gal for a ??? : *how* the worried blues left here
I think I heard : my good gal call my name
She couldn't call so loud : but she calls so nice and plain
I was raised in Texas : schooled in Tennessee
High-stepper you can't make : no fatmouth out of me
Can't a woman act funny : quit you for another man
Can't go look down the street : but she's always raising sand

My right foot itches : something going on wrong
My right foot itching me : and I just can't stay here long
I thought I'd write : but it's the best to telephone
For that fast mail train : can carry your sugar so far from home
Girl I can't live right : ain't going to try no more
This woman's left town : and she ain't coming back no more
I went to the depot : and I set my suitcase down
I thought about my baby : and tears come rolling down
I said ticket agent : how long your train been gone
Say yon go the train : that this fair brown left here on
I couldn't buy [me] no ticket : but I walked on to the door
Well my baby left town : she ain't coming here no more
I got up this morning : my sure-enough on my mind

Excuse me woman : I won't say that no more
I'm fixing to leave town : and hang crepe on your door

Well my mind leads me : to take a trip down south
Take a trip down south : *it's tough to spend my round*
A train left the depot : with a red and blue light behind
Well the blue light's the blues : the red light's the worried mind
I hate to tell you : it ain't nobody there
If a man stay here : he stay most anywhere
I got up this morning : rambling for my shoes
The little woman : sung me a song of her worried blues
Uncle Sam wasn't no woman : but didn't he grab your man
Tell me them good-looking womens : is on the border raising sand
Well women on the border : drinking out of the water trough
I wish uncle Sam would hurry up : and pay these soldiers off
I can't drink coffee : and the woman won't make no tea
I believe to my soul : sweet mama going to hoodoo me
I asked the girl did she love me : she said Lemon I don't know how
Caught me *commentating* : yes I love you *sky high*
She has feet like a monkey : head like a teddy bear
And a mouthful of lip : I guarantee it's everywhere
I got a girl in Cuba : I got a girl in Spain
I got a brown yonder in Dallas : I's afraid to call her name

[Tell me, I want to know] what time : do the trains come through your town
I want to laugh and talk : with a long-haired teasing brown
One goes south at eight : and it's one goes north at nine
I got to have a good talk : with that long-haired brown of mine
Go and get my black horse : and saddle up my grey mare
I'm going home to my good gal : she's in the world somewhere
I can't count the times : that I'm so unsatisfied
Sugar the blues ain't on me : but things ain't going on right

See see rider : you see what you done done
Made me love you : and now your friend is come
A great tall engine : and a little small engineer
Carried the woman away Lord : and left me standing here
If I had a-listened : to my second mind
I don't believe I'd a-been here : wringing my hands and crying
Ain't no more good 'taters : the frost have killed the vine
The blues ain't nothing : but a good woman on your mind
I done told you woman : I been telling your partner too
You're three times seven : and you know what you want to do
If you see Corinna : tell her to hurry home
I ain't had no true love : since Corinna been gone

So many wagons : they have cut that good road down
And the girl I love : her mama don't want me around
Baby I can't drink whiskey : but I'm a fool about my homemade wine
Ain't no sense in leaving Dallas : they makes it there all the time
These here women want these men : to act like some boxer dog
Grab a pick and shovel : and roll from sun to sun
I got a girl for Monday Tuesday : Wednesday Thursday Friday too
I'm going to sweeten up on Saturday : what are the women through the week going to do
Don't look for me on Sunday : I want to take pigmeat to Sunday school
She's a fine looking fair brown : but she ain't never learned Lemon's rule

Listen here mama : I'll be good
Drink your wine : cut your wood
When I had you : you wouldn't do
Now I got another : and I don't want you
Every evening : half past eight
*Hobbling along* : *with my gait*
Working in the spring : *sleeping in the sand*
Got to get that fifty dollars : that I wish I had
You may think : because you're black
I'm going to beg you : to take me back
I went a-walking : down the line
To see if this woman : changed her mind
She turned around : two or three times
Take you back : in the wintertime

I ain't going to marry : ain't going to [be no settling, settle] down
I'm going to stay like I am : going to ride from town to town
There's a house over yonder : painted all over green
Going to find these young women : that a man most ever seen
I'm going to run to town : talk with that chief of police
Tell him my good gal has quit me : and I can't live in no peace
My home's in Oklahoma : I ain't got no business here
I'm just stopping around : to have a drink of a little drink of beer
I went home last night : fell down on my bed
I got to dreaming so : I was talking all out of my head

Somebody : just keep on calling me
She got hair : like a mermaid on the sea
Make me down a pallet : on your floor
Make it ??? and easy : make it down by your door
I can't stay away : I done cried the whole night long
The good woman I love : she done packed her trunk and gone
Don't mistreat me : because I'm young and wild
Sister you ought to remember : that you once was a child
I don't feel welcome : and I don't care where I go
The woman I love : she drove me from her door
Said fair brown : where did you stay last night
Your hair's all down : and you know you ain't talking right
I'm a stranger here : just come in on the train
Won't some good man : tell me some woman's name

Oh : ain't got no mama now
She told me late last night : you don't need no mama nohow
Mmm : black snake crawling in my room
Some pretty mama : better come and get this black snake soon
Oh that must've been a bedbug : baby a chinch can't bite that hard
Asked my sugar for fifty cents : she said Lemon ain't a dime in the yard
Mama that's all right : mama that's all right for you
Mama that's all right : most any old way you do
Mmm : what's the matter now
Sugar what's the matter : don't like no black snake nohow
Mmm : wonder where my black snake gone
Black snake mama : done run my darling home

What you going to do : when they send your man to war
I'm going to drink muddy water : go sleep in a hollow log
Ain't got nobody : I'm all here by myself
Well these women don't care : but the men don't need me here
Well I'm going to the river : going to walk it up and down
If I don't find *fourteen* : I'm going to jump overboard and drown
If I could shine my light : like a headlight on some train
I would shine my light : in Corinna's brain
Well they tell me that southbound train : had a wreck last night
You little section foreman : ain't treating your railroad right
Well the girl I love : is the one I crave to see
Well she's living in Memphis : and the fool won't write to me
Now tell me woman : what have I said and done
You treat me : like my trouble have just begun

I am broke and hungry : ragged and dirty too
Mama if I clean up : can I go home with you
I am motherless fatherless : sister and brotherless too
Reason I'm trying so hard : to make the trip with you
You miss me woman : count the days I'm gone
I'm going away : to build me a railroad of my own
I feel like jumping : through the keyhole in your door
If you jump this time baby : you won't jump no more
I believe : my good gal have found my black cat bone
I can leave here Sunday morning : Monday morning I'm sitting around home
I want to show you women : what careless love have done
Caused a man like me : steal way away from home
Girl if you don't want me : why don't you let me know
So I can leave at once : and hunt me somewhere else to go

I've got your picture : and I'm going to put it in a frame
And then if you leave town : we can find you just the same
Now if you don't love me : please don't dog me around
If you dog me around : I know you put me down
I know my baby : thinks the world and all of me
Every time she smiles : she shines her light on me
Oh I said fair brown : something's going on wrong
This here woman I love : she's done been here and gone
Oh listen fair brown : don't you want to go
Going to take you across the water : where that brownskin man can't go
Lord I'm worried here : worried everywhere
Now I just started home : and I'll not be worried there
Lord I'm tired of being married : tired of this settling down
I only want to stay like I am : and slip from town to town

I drived to the station : woman I bid you all adieu
Tell me : you always got a fatmouth following you
Now my baby quit me : and she done throwed me down

She's a long tall woman : she got relatives in Arkansas
She ain't so good-looking : but boys them dimples is *going to draw*
I cried all night : and all that night before
Know it's the best to get single : then you won't have to cry no more
I got ten little puppies : I got twelve little shaggy hounds
Well it just takes them twenty-two dogs : to run my good gal down
I got a girl in *North Clifton* : *hollering for a good long-legged man* too
I may live in Magnolia Texas : what them Mill City women going to do
Some joker learned my baby : how to shift gears on a Cadillac Eight
If you ever shift that habit : now I can't keep my business straight

Blues jumped a rabbit : run him one solid mile
This rabbit sat down : cried like a natural child
Well it seem like you hungry : honey come and lunch with me
I want to stop these married-looking women : from worrying me
I have Uneeda biscuits here : and a half a pint of gin
The gin is mighty fine : them biscuits are a little too thin
[Baby tell me something, I want to know] : about those meatless and wheatless days
This not being my home : I don't think I could stay
I cried for flour and meat : I declare it was gone
Keep a-feeding me corn bread : I just can't stick around long
Got an airplane baby : now I'm going to get a submarine
Going to get that Kaiser : and we'll be seldom seen
Mmm hitch me to your buggy mama : drive me like a mule
Reason I'm going home with you sugar : I ain't much hard to be fooled

I want to go home : and I ain't got sufficient clothes

I bet my money : and I lost it Lord it's dough
I'll never bet : on this old trey game no more
Oh my ??? *gambler's* gone : why don't you quit crying
That joker stole off : with that long-haired brown of mine
Sister you catch the Katy : I'll catch that Santa Fe
When you get to Denver : pretty mama look around for me
The woman I love : why she's five feet from the ground
She's a tailor-made woman : she ain't no hand-me-down
I ain't seen my sugar : in two long weeks today
Girl it's been so long : seems like my heart going to break
I'm going to run across town : catch that southbound Santa Fe
Be on my way : to what you call loving Tennessee

Hey : ain't got no mama now
She told me late last night : you don't need no mama nohow
Mmm : black snake crawling in my room
And some pretty mama : had better come and get this black snake soon
Oh that must have been a bedbug : you know a chinch can't bite that hard
Asked my baby for fifty cents : she said Lemon ain't a dime in the yard
Mama that's all right : mama that's all right for you
Said baby that's all right : most any old way you do
Mmm : what's the matter now
Tell me what's the matter baby : I don't like no black snake nohow
Well : wonder where's that black snake gone
Lord that black snake mama : done run my darling home

I'm going to the river : going to walk down by the sea
I got those tadpoles and minnows : arguing over me
Sitting here wondering : would a matchbox hold my clothes
I ain't got so many matches : but I got so far to go
Lord mama : who may your manager be
He asked so many questions : can you make arrangements for me
I got a brown across town : she crochet all the time
Baby if you don't quit crocheting : you going lose your mind
I wouldn't mind marrying : but I can't stand settling down
I'm going to act like a preacher : so I can ride from town to town
I'm leaving town : crying won't make me stay
Baby the more you cry : the further you drive me away

Now tell me : where my easy rider's gone
Now easy riding woman : always in the wrong
Well easy rider : died on the road
I'm a poor blind man : ain't got nowhere to go
It's going to be the time : that a woman don't need no man
Then baby shut your mouth : and don't be raising sand
The train I ride : don't burn no coal at all
The coal I'm burning : everybody says it's cannonballs
I mean I went to the depot : and set my suitcase down
The blues overtake me : and tears come rolling down
The woman I love : she must be out of town
She left me this morning : with a face that's full of frowns
I got a gal across town : she crochets all the time
Baby if you don't quit crocheting : you going to lose your mind
Said fair brown : what's the matter now
You turn your back to quit me : woman and you don't know how

I'm sitting here wondering : will a matchbox hold my clothes
I ain't got so many matches : but I got so far to go
Brown across town : going to be my teddy bear
Put that thing on me : and I'll follow you everywhere
I say a peg leg woman : just can't hardly get her dough
I left one in Lakeport last night : and I'm selling jellyroll
I don't see why : these women treat me so mean
Sometimes I think : a good man these women ain't never seen
Well I got up this morning : with my [sure-enough, same thing] on my mind
The woman I love : she keeps a good man worried all the time
Now tell me mama : who may your manager be
I asked so many questions : can't you make arrangements for me

I'm sitting here wondering : will a matchbox hold my clothes
I ain't got so many matches : but I got so far to go
I said fair brown : who may your manager be
He asked so many questions : can't you make arrangements for me
I got a girl across town : she crochets all the time
Sugar the blues ain't on me : but things ain't going on right
Mama if you don't quit crocheting : you going to lose your mind
I can't count the times : I stoled away and cried
If you want your [lover, baby] : you better pin him to your side
If she flag my train : papa Lemon's going to let her ride
Ain't seen my good gal : in three long weeks today
Lord it's been so long : seems like my heart going to break
Excuse me mama : for knocking on your door
If my mind don't change : I'll never knock here no more

Backwater rising : southern people can't make no time
And I can't get no hearing : from that Memphis gal of mine
Water all in Arkansas : people screaming in Tennessee
If I don't leave Memphis : black water been all over poor me
People since it's raining : it has been for nights and days
Thousand people stands on the hill : looking down where they used to stay
Children stand there screaming : mama we ain't got no home
Papa says to children : black water left us all alone
Backwater rising : come in my windows and doors
I leave with a prayer in my heart : backwater won't rise no more

I hate to hear : my good gal call my name
She don't call so loud : but she call so nice and plain
Lord the train I ride : eighteen coaches long
And the girl I love : she's just now leaving home
Well a high brown girl : loves to ride away somewhere
If a man is worthy : she would make you a millionaire
Don't never drive : a stranger away from your door
It could be your best friend : mama you don't know
Don't tell no stories : please don't tell no lies
Did my gal stop here : Lord did the mama keep on by
Oh if you don't love me : pretty mama don't run no stall
There's a whole lots of women : *just ran through your brown's hall*

I'm going to make friends : with the fish in the deep blue sea
And stop the Chicago women : from arguing over me
Come here pretty mama : going to take you far across the pond
I'm going to make my stop in Italy : where the monkey-man don't belong
These women in Chicago : they like their fashions and forms
But these women from Nashville : swear they just won't be here long
I said fair brown : let me be your teddy bear
Tie a string on my neck : and I'll follow everywhere

Black snake is deceitful : crawling in all in my bed
I had a dream last night : black snake is killed my baby dead
Hey hey mama : black [snake's lying, snake is] all in my hall
And if you quit me mama : you can't see that black snake at all
Listen here mama : black snake is wearing my clothes
And I told you about it : and you put my trunk outdoors
Take me back mama : I [won't, can't] be bad no more
And you can get my loving : if you let that black snake go
Black snake crawl out : he said he don't mean no harm
But I'm getting tired of that black snake : lying in my baby's arms

I'm going away : now don't you want to go
I'm going to stop at a place : I haven't never been before
I ain't got no watch : I ain't got no *China spoon*
Reason I'm hanging around here : man I'm sticking here dry long so
If you got a sweet woman : you better love her while you can
For your heart strike sorrow : when I come back to town again
I lie down last night : rolled from side to side
Say that the blues ain't on me : but things ain't going on right
I drink so much whiskey : I travel in my sleep
For that brown across town : I declare she is worrying me
I believe I'll sing this song : ain't going to sing no more
Going to leave town : and hang crepe on your door

Well the train's ??? : track's all out of line
And I commence to how I want to : catch that Number Nine
I'm worried and bothered : don't know what to do
Reason I'm worried and bothered : it's all on account of you
When I left home : I left my baby crying
She keeps me worried : and bothered in the mind
Now don't your house look lonesome : when your baby pack up and leave
You may drink your moonshine : but baby your heart ain't free
If you take my rider : I can't get mad with you
Just like you taken mine : I'll take someone else's too
I got a girl in Texas : I got a brown in Tennessee
Lord but that brown in Chicago : have put that jinx bug on me

I never feel uneasy : I know how you love your tricks
You leave town the spate of ten days : you got your business well fixed
I wonder if the chinches bite in Beaumont : bite like they do in Beale Street town
The first night I stayed in Memphis : chinch bugs turned my bed around
I had to get sinful with the bedbugs : to keep the chinches from taking my life
Because the chinches got my number : wrote a letter to my wife
My wife caught me easing : way across that Richland Road
The next time I go to slip out : I ain't going to leave on the light anymore
My wife has quit me : and my best pigmeat gal has too
All of ??? *Lord* : here with the chinch bug blues

There's a brown across town : and she's taller as a sycamore tree
That's the gal'd walk through the rain and snow : for to ease that thing on me
Brownskin girl is deceitful : till she gets you all worn down
She get all your pocket change : she going drive you from her town
Went home last night : found a note in my brownskin's door
Daddy *stay long* has got your room : man you can't live here no more
I [begun to walk, commenced walking] : walked till my feet got soaking wet
Trying to find good home mama : man I ain't found none yet
Well the sun's going to shine : in my back door some day
Ah it's one more drink : going to drive these blues away
Lord it's heavy-hipped mama : and the meat shakes on the bone
Every time it shakes : it's a sign my baby's home

Burn the railroad down : so that Sunshine Special can't run
I got a gang of women : man they ride from sun to sun
Same old fireman : going to keep this same old engineer
So that Sunshine Special : is going to run me on away from here
Going to leave on the Sunshine Special : going in on the Santa Fe
Going to *set up and stop* that Katy : because it's taking my brown from me
Going to ride that kansas Texas : right on to San Antone
Somebody's been trying to fire your engines : man ever since you been gone
Cotton Belt is a slow train : also that I and C N
If I leave Texas anymore : going to leave on that L and N

I had a dream last night : all about my gal
You can tell by that : sweet papa ain't been so well
I'm going away mama : just to wear you off my mind
So if I live in Chicago : murder's going to be my crime
This house is lonesome : my baby left me all alone
If your heart ain't rock : sugar it must be marble stone
I got the blues so bad : it hurts my feet to walk
It has settled on my brain : and it hurts my tongue to talk

Take Fort Worth for your dressing : and Dallas all for your sal
So you want to go to the state penitentiary : go to Grossbeck for your trial
I hung around Grossbeck : I work in hard showers of rain
I never felt the least bit uneasy : till I caught that penitentiary bound train
I used to be a drunkard : rowdy everywhere I go
If ever I get out of this trouble I'm in : man I won't be rowdy no more
Boys don't be bad : please don't crowd your mind
If you get in trouble in Grossbeck : they going to send you to penitentiary flying
I want you to stop and study : don't take nobody's life
They got walls at the state penitentiary : you can't jump man as hard as you try

I walked to the jail with my partner : asked him how come he's here
I had a *ruckus* with my family : they going to send me to the electric chair
I wonder why they electrocute a man : *if he ??? line*
Because the current's much stronger : *when they send it straight out on the line*
*I said to the electrocutor* : *awful lousy crime*
And my baby asked the judge : was he going to electrocute that man of mine
Going to get me a taxi : to take me away from here
I don't know but one thing in this world : could keep me *married* to the electric chair
I feel like jumping in the ocean : I feel like jumping in the deep blue sea
There wasn't no blood left in my heart : and they brought my  electrocuted daddy to me

I'm going to tell you why : I got Lemon's lowdown worried blues
I left my meal ticket down at ??? : my pot of chitlings boiling a little past noon
Lord I'm worried here : worried everywhere I go
I worried my rider so late last night : she had a mule wagon backed up to my door
I woke up this morning : took a walk till the break of day
I asked for a woman to marry me : and I just made my get-away
I woke up this morning : woke up about half past ten
Ease my head in the window : she's singing Lemon's worried blues again
Worried so bad : can't tell my stockings from my shoes
I lay down last night : with Lemon's lowdown worried blues
Lord what makes that [banty] rooster : he keeps crowing for the dawn of day
His man better watch his footsteps for the hen : now doggone his ways

I feel like jumping : through the keyhole in your door
If you jump this time baby : you won't jump no more
I feel like falling : from treetops to the ground
My rider's got a mean jumper : and he don't allow me around
I go there early in the morning : and I goes there late at night
Don't care how late I goes there : he hasn't ever turned down his light
I believe he's looking for me : he's up all hours at night
She used to be my rider : and he ain't treating her right
I met this jumper one morning : he was out on the out edge of town
I had to talk and plead : for to keep him from blowing me down

I got up this morning : sure was feeling fine
I heard a rap at the door : must be that bad cat woman of mine
She was fussing she was fighting : and acting like a doggone fool
And hemming and a-hawing : and acting just like a balky mule
Bad cat ain't no wildcat : and he's going to stay home at night
But when it comes to squabbling : he sure can scratch and bite
I got up this morning : I was easing across this floor
Now my bad cat's leaving me : ain't going to catch my mice no more
I was standing on the corner : when they brought me the bad cat news
Now here come my bad cat mama : to run me away with them bad cat blues

Hey hey mama : that rider's done and gone
I just can't see : what in the world is you waiting on
I've got another mama : she ain't long and up tall
But to tell you the truth man : she is as soft as a butterball
She got Elgin movements : from her head down to her toe
And she can break in on a dollar : man most anywhere she goes
She was my best mama : but she wouldn't treat me right
She wouldn't do nothing : but barrelhouse all night long
I'm going to get me a mama : I mean with lots of bucks
I'm going to be gone mama : so I can change my luck

Getting tired of sleeping : in this lowdown lonesome cell
Lord I wouldn't've been here : if it hadn't've been for Nell
Lay awake at night : and just can't eat a bite
Used to be my rider : but she just won't treat me right
Got a red-eyed captain : and a squabbling boss
Got a mad dog sergeant : honey and he won't knock off
I asked the government : to knock some days off my time
Well the way I'm treated : I'm about to lose my mind
I wrote to the governor : please turn me a-loose
Since I didn't get no answer : I know it ain't no use
I hate to turn over : and find my rider gone
Walked across my floor : Lordy how I moan
Lord I wouldn't've been here : if it hadn't've been for Nell
I'm getting tired of sleeping : in this lowdown lonesome cell

I wonder why : my partner sitting around looking sad
I mean the woman if she quit me : it's going to be too black bad
She's a fair made woman : and she's cunning as a squirrel
When she starts to loving : man it's out the world
Oh she's a dark brownskin : we always call her chocolate drop
If the fool starts a-loving : man it just won't stop
When I first met the woman : I says I hadn't made no hit
She got this old-fashioned loving : man it just won't quit
I met her at a *sociable* : she acts just like a crook
Lord when she starts to loving : man it ain't in the book

Lord heavy-hipped mama : she done moved to the piney wood
She's a high-stepping mama : and she don't mean no man no good
She got ways like the devil : and hair like a Indian squaw
She been trying two years : to get me to be her son-in-law
Big mama : own everything in her neighborhood
But when she made the money : is when she lived in the piney wood
Blues in my kitchen : blues in my dining room
And some nice young fair brown : had better come here soon
Well the cook's in the kitchen : picking and fussing over turnip greens
White folks in the parlor playing cards : and they're serving their cake and tea
My baby loves my baby : like a cow loves to chew her cud
But that fool just off and left me : she done moved to the piney wood

I love my baby : better than a farmer likes his Jersey cow
Been trying to quit my baby for two years : and man I don't know how
When I was young : on my big-foot way to school
I met a nice-looking brownskin : made me lose my mammy's rule
My rider's got a mojo : and she won't let me see
Every time I start to loving : she ease that thing on me
She's got to fool her daddy : she's got to keep that mojo hid
But papa's got something : for to find that mojo with
She got four speeds forward : and she don't never stall
The way she bumps over the hill : it would make a panther squall

Competition worrying me : you been having a competition with me
*Big foot* stops at every man's door : and he's always in his midnight creep
I have a loving brown : I did never miss it *till her gone*
I found a ??? competition : he better not get in town
I passed my partner's house : I stopped in to comb my head
Who should I find : but my gal making up my partner's bed
I'm going to wreck my mind : competition going between me and my friend
It hurt me so : I thought we'd be pals till the end
It makes a man feel bad : when competition
Now there's so much competition : I believe I'll leave your town

I got a letter : I got a letter here in my hand
My brown wrote to tell me sad news : she got a brand new man
I'm a long long way from home : I ain't got no *lover* in town
I'm going to get that *B and M* to Baltimore boy : I heard my baby *is there*
I was drinking all night [long] : got up this morning sloppy drunk
I would pack my things : but somebody done stole my trunk
I went uptown last night : I tried drinking hard to ease my pain
But you ain't got no money : so don't come back here again
It's sad news : when your baby's ???ing on you
Even though you been kind : there's nothing that you can do

Standing at the station : watch my baby leave town
I feel disgusted : no peace can be found
Now you can hear the whistles blowing : but I just can't see no train
Way down in my heart : got a lot of aches and pains
Sometime I feel disgusted : and I feel so blue
I hardly know what in this world baby : a good man can do
If I could holler : just like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain : and call my baby back
Some day you're going to be sorry : you ever done me wrong
It'll be too late darling : your man will be gone
My mind goes to wondering : I feel so bad
Thinking about the trouble : a good man always have

I used to take my feet : in a midnight tramp
Now they got me : doing a different kind of dance
I couldn't keep away from [wild, bad] women : bad [liquor, whiskey] cards and dice
Now I'm doing the lock-step baby : things ain't going so nice
It don't matter to me : whether it sunshine snow or rains
Because I can't go gay cutting : and carry a ball and chain
Mean old jailor : taking away my dancing shoes
I can't strut my stuff : when I got those lock-step blues
Big rats in my cell : keeps me woke all night
My woman done turned me down : and I don't think that's right
Every morning : I walk down that big long hall
I'm screaming for my mama : can't make no time at all

Hangman's rope : it's so tough and strong
They got to hang me : because I done something wrong
I want to tell you : the gallows Lord is a fearful sight
Hang me in the morning : and cut me down at night
Well the mean old hangman : he went and tightened up that noose
Lord I'm so scared : I am trembling in my shoes
[Jury, jurymen] heard my case : and it said my hand was red
And the judge is telling me : be hanging till I'm dead
The crowd around the courthouse : and the time is growing fast
Soon a good-for-nothing killer : is going to breathe his last
Lord I'm almost dying : gasping for my breath
And that trifling woman staying : until I breaks my neck

Now it's the day before Christmas : mama won't you hear me moan
If you take me back baby : I'll give you anything you need
I had a good chance : baby give me just one more
I will change the way I'm loving : like you never have been before
I know I did do wrong : I'm just as sorry as I can be
It's the day before Christmas : mama come back to me
Mama don't turn me down : on this Christmas Eve
I cried about you so hard : done wetted my whole coat sleeve
It's the day before Christmas : let me bring [me] your present  tonight
I'm going to be your Santa Claus : even if my whiskers ain't white

I'm thinking about the year : of nineteen and twenty-nine
New year caught me with *marked money* : man I was doing just fine
I was lying down with my baby : we had one small quart of gin
That old doorbell kept ringing : I wouldn't leave nobody come in
The whistle was blowing for New Year : around twelve o'clock at night
I lied down on there with my baby : until the good Lord brought daylight
Early one New Year morning : I was walking down by the hill
Every man likes his liquor : when he gets it fresh from the still
I hate to drink all new year : for this whiskey they making is too strong
Because when I take two or three drinks : I'll be drunk the whole year long

Rats is mean in my kitchen : and I lost my Maltese cat
I'm going to make things right with my good gal : man and it's tight like that
I'm going to start walking : walk the shoes clean off of my feet
Just thinking about my mama : and man that woman sure is sweet
I ain't got no suitcase : I don't have a one bottle of gin
I've got to stay drunk to keep warm : because my clothes is so thin
Long lonesome train : come passing me a-flying
I was thinking about my mama : and I didn't pay that train no mind
When you get a-home : buy a Maltese cat
And a good strong brownskin : man it's tight like that

Who is that coming : hey with a motor so strong
That's Lemon in his D B : people think he's got his girl out on
Going to get out of my four-cylinder Dodge : I want to get me a Super Six
I'm always around the ladies : and I like to have my business fixed
I'm crazy about a Packard : but my baby only rates a Ford
A Packard is too expensive : Ford will take you where you want to go
Come here brownskin : listen to my motor roar
Because my Super Six sufficient : to take you where you want to go
I never did like no horses : I never could stand no *steel*
Ever since I was old enough to catch a brown : give me the automobile

My woman got eyes like an eagle : and she watching me all the time
The way she follow me around : Lordy it's going to be a crime
Watching me all through the day : watching me all through the night
Keeps her eagle eyes on me : till the good Lord brings daylight
Mmm : papa Lemon's feeling so blue
Eagle-eyed mama's worrying me : what am I going to do
Dog in my back yard : oh Lordy how he can howl
I'm trying to quit that eagle-eyed woman : man and I don't know how
My eagle-eyed woman : is got ways I can't explain
If I ever leave her : I must be going insane

I feel like tramping : from the *great big corral*
Because the woman I love : says she don't want me nohow
She swore that she loved me : but I know that she doing me wrong
I'm going to start something man : and I tell you it won't be long
The way I feel now : I could get a keg of dynamite
Put it all in her window : and blow her up late at night
I just swallowed some fire : take a drink of gasoline
Throw it up all over that woman : and let her go off and scream
I'm going to get in a cannon : and let them blow me out to sea
Going down with the whales : and the mermaids make love to me

There ain't nothing mama : no use
There's a long distance well : and it's blowing oil that's all
Ain't nothing to hurt you : it ain't nothing that's bad
It's the first oil well : that *your* ??? ever had
I'm a long distance driller : and I work every country through
Going to stop working : if I bring in this well for you
I'm a mean old well driller : and I been a driller since I been a man
Ain't going to stop drilling : till I strikes that *Woodburn sand*
I got a [mean] reputation : and they call me Drilling Sam
When I starts to drilling : you hear women hollering too black bad

I was down and I cried : *my pillowcase was on the line*
Ain't it tough to see a man : go to *wreck and almost fall and die*
I stood on the corner : and almost bust my head
I couldn't earn enough money : to buy me a loaf of bread
Baby times is so hard : I almost call it tough
I can't earn money to buy no bread : and you know I can't buy my snuff
My gal's a housemaid : and she earns a dollar a week
And I'm so hungry on payday : I can't hardly speak
Now gather around me people : let me tell you a true fact
That tough luck has sunk me : and the rats is creeping in my hat

The furniture man : he done been here and gone
Taking all my furniture : didn't left nothing for me to sit down on
Well it's tough to be alone : when I got to have my biscuits browned
Most of these women I know : cooking ??? *down for down*
I loved my baby in the morning : Lord loved her late at night
I miss that midnight loving : and you know I ain't treated right
I feel so disgusted : and I hate to be alone
I'm getting some other man's loving : when I ought to be getting my own
My love is like a storm : what blowed the walls all down
Soon as you get some of my loving : they can't keep you out of town

Every Saturday : go to work in a doggone place
*With food in my craw* : I goes there for *spending place*
I find six or seven women : and a whole lots of fun
Then we go out and break them down : honey till early morn
I don't mind no men friends : but I am afraid of my grandma's child
I like me a-plenty of women : but man I like them wild
All during the week : I work hard and I really save
But on a Saturday night : I can get all the loving I crave
Now I can't have the times : like I once have had
My regular found out I was a Saturday night spender : and it sure did make her mad

Mmm : going to run that black snake down
I ain't seen my mama : since black snake taken her away from town
Mmm : black snake is so hard to find
I am worried about my mama : I can't keep her off my mind
Oh : better find my mama soon
I woke up this morning : black snake was making *easy ruckus* in my room
Black snake is evil : black snake is all I see
I woke up this morning : black snake was moving in on me
Mmm : black snake was hanging around
He occupied my livingroom : and broke my *fairybook* down

Peach orchard mama : you swore nobody'd pick your fruit but me
I found three kid-men : shaking down your peaches tree
One man bought your groceries : another joker paid your rent
While I work in your orchard : and giving you every cent
Went to the police station : begged the police to put me in jail
I didn't want to kill you mama : but I hate to see your peaches tree fail
Peach orchard mama : don't treat your papa so mean
Chase out all those kid-men : and let me keep your orchard clean
Peach orchard mama : don't turn your papa down
Because when I gets mad : I acts just like a clown

My feets is so cold : can't hardly wear my shoes
Out last night with wild women : and it give me the big night blues
I grabbed my baby : I danced till the clock struck twelve
I had to wrestle so hard with my good gal : I just ain't feeling so well
I'm going back to that party : get with them wild women again
Well I ain't going to leave my home : till I order me a quart of gin
Wild women like their liquor : their gin and their rocking rye
My gal wouldn't let me go home last night : wouldn't tell me the reason why
Turned my face to the wall : and my baby made an awful moan
Well I needs my daddy : because my clock is run down at home

Got something to tell you : make the hair rise on your head
Got a new way of getting down : make the springs tremble on your bed
My gal got a new way of trembling down : make a crazy man leave his home
When she grabs you and turns you loose : makes the flesh tremble on your bones
Well my gal got something at home : that I sure do like
That's the long folding bed : with the cover all right back
Don't blame me mama : for talking out my head
I'm worried about the movements you got : and those springs trembling on your bed

I want to yo-yo : but I broke my yo-yo string
I believe my baby's going crazy losing her mind : Lord the woman is going insane
Don't a man feel bad : when he can't yo-yo no more
Broke my yo-yo string last night : and I can't come home no more
My sugar got ways : partner I can't understand
Leave me all in my bed : go yo-yo with some other man
I love me yo-yo : better than anything I know
I'm feeling funny and foolish : I can't shake that thing no more

Lamp sits in my kitchen : mosquitoes all around my screen
I'm about all ready to get a mosquito bomb : I'll be seldom seen
[I'm going to, I believe I'll] keep on the Pinto : drive on back to Brandyville
Oh mosquitoes so bad in this man's town : keep me away from my whiskey still
I love my whiskey : better than some people like to eat
Mosquitoes bother me so : I can't hardly stay on my feet
I bought a spray last night : and I sprayed all over my house
Mosquitoes all around my door : won't leave nobody come out
Mosquitoes all around me : mosquitoes are everywhere I go
No matter where I go : well they sticks their bills in me
I wouldn't say a gabber-nipper : these gabber-nippers bite too hard
I stepped back in my kitchen : and they springing up in my back yard

Way down south : you ought to see the women shimmy and shake
Their new way of wiggle : make a weak man break his neck
You fed me greens : and I mean that they really can cook
Make me a jellyroll : and I mean it's out the book
I was down south : where all my whiskey cook
Just looking at them women : makes me want to get my gauge stuck
Southern women : man [they're, they sure is] hard to beat
Ain't so easy to get along with : but Lord so sweet
I'm going down south : and I believe I'll take my hook
I'm going to fish in southern women : I declare it's out the book
Me and my sugar : *something I did hold*
I won't go to fishing : mama I done broke my pole

I'm standing in front of the bakershop : and I'm feeling lowdown in mind
Hungry as could be : looking at all cakes of kind
Girl in the bakershop : she hollered papa don't look so sad
Come and try some of my cake : and you won't feel so bad
*And with* sweet rolls in the window : honey and light bread cold
I want to buy me some cake : but I had shot dice and lost my roll
I'm crazy about my light bread : and my pigmeat on the side
If I had a piece of your jellyroll : honey I'd be satisfied
I want to know if your jellyroll fresh : I want to know if your jellyroll's stale
I'm going to haul off and buy me some : if I have to break her loose in jail
It's hard to be broke : and so hungry you about to drop
If I don't get a break soon : I'll fall dead front of this bakershop

I'm aching all over : believe I got the pneumonia this time
And it's all on account of : that lowdown gal of mine
Slinking around the corner : running up alleys too
Watching my woman : trying to see what she going to do
Stood down in the street : one cold dark stormy night
Trying to see : if my good gal going to make it home all right
[I believe she's, she must have] found something : that probably made her fall
I stood out in the cold all night : and she didn't come home at all
Wear B V Ds in the winter : traveling around in the rain
Last time : my baby give me this pneumonia pain
Now when I die : bury me in a Stetson hat
Tell my good gal I'm going : but I'm still a-standing pat

I'm flying to South Carolina : I got to go there this time
Women in Dallas Texas : is about to make me lose my mind
Long distance long distance : will you please give me a credit call
Want to talk to my gal in South Carolina : who looks like a Indian squaw
Just want to ask my baby : what in the world is she been doing
Give your loving to another joker : and it's sure going to be my ruin
Hey long distance : I can't help but moan
My baby's voice sound so sweet : oh I'm going to break this telephone
You don't know you love your rider : till she is so far from you
You can get long distance moan : and you don't care what you do
I think I will use ??? poison : to get my brownie off my mind
This long distance moan : about to worry me to death this time

Well the baby crawling : on up to his mama's knee
He's crying about his sweet milk : and she won't feed him just that cream
Crawled from the fireplace : and he stopped in the middle of the floor
Said mama ain't that your second daddy : standing back there in the door
Well she grabbed my baby and spanked him : I tried to make her leave him alone
I tried my best to stop her : and she said that baby ain't none of mine
Some woman rocks the cradle : and I declare she rules her home
Many man rocks some other man's baby : and the fool thinks he's rocking his own
It was late last night : when I liked to crawl in baby's room
My woman threw my clothes outdoors : and now I got those crawling baby blues

Here comes two women : I liked to drove them wild
Well you drinking bad liquor : you'll be overtaken after a while
He must be desperated : I don't know nothing else it could be
Standing on the corner didn't mean no harm : the boy made a dash at me
Made a break at me : groped for my pocketknife
One had me cooling off : while the other one talked about taking my wife
And when I went for my gun : you ought to see them yelling breaking that fence
I first thought they was crazy : but I found out they didn't have no sense
You can take my money : I mean you can wear my best clothes
Lemon won't kill no quicker : if you bother with my jellyroll
Some people like their sugar : I'm a fool about my China tea
You can have all this world : but leave my honeycomb home with me

Cat man cat man : stay away from my house at night
Prowling around my back door when I'm gone : you know that ain't right
When I come home last night I heard a noise : asked my wife what was that
She said don't be so suspicious : that wasn't a thing but a cat
I've been all over the world : I've taken all kinds of chance
I've never seen a cat : come home in a pair of pants
I'm tired of this jellyroll man : come to my home when I'm out
Know it's the cause of my woman : boys is *necking* about
Reason I call him cat man : he don't [come, go] around in the day
Come around at midnight : steals my cream when I'm away
Tell me a cat got nine lives : honey and I believe that's true
If the cat man is got nine lives : he going to need them when I get through

I got a brownskin mama : she built right to the ground
When I goes to her house : old man starts to booting me around
Now you mustn't blame his gal : it's nailed up to his door
Don't want to go near no man : pretty soon she'll be too old
Hey here Mr : you must be losing your mind
Everybody's got to have : a little bit of loving sometime
Her father told me : better not to come back no more
If I catch you here : I'm going to boot you through the door
I love my little brownskin : she's so young and green
The old man's the bootingest thing : that I most ever seen
I got to find me a scheme : to get my gal all to herself
Because I'm a fool about that woman : don't want nobody else

Lord I'm broke and hungry : and my money's all gone
Weather is summer : I've got to travel on
All my crops a failure : couldn't raise a doggone thing
I'm just like a beggar : hear these lonesome blues I sing
If I steal a pork chop : Lord I believe I'll pass away
I ain't had a square meal : in many doggone days
I'm so broke and hungry : I could eat a kangaroo
I feel just like stealing : there's nothing else to do
Won't somebody help me : with a little bite to eat
Don't care what you give me : I'd eat even chicken meat
Standing on the roadside : with a great big sign it read
Say Uneeda biscuits : ??? near dropped dead
My body feels so weary : because I got the miss-meal cramp
Right now I could eat more : than a whole carload of tramps

I went out last night I got drunk : I was in whiskey up to my head
A young lady she walked up to me : and this is what she said
I told her to give me time : and let me think
And I'd tell her : exactly when to buy that expensive drink
I went to see a fortuneteller : just to have my fortune told
She says young man you are partly rich : you're worth a great big pot of gold
I got myself a pick and shovel : I reached twelve that night
When I got there : I do declare I spied a form all dressed in white
Now me and this haunt : run breast and breast
He says look here brother : when are you going to rest

Sunbeam's on time : I ain't got my fare
And if I start walking : Sunbeam will beat me there
Don't need an airplane : steamboat or submarine
But if I miss the Sunbeam : I will be seldom seen

Standing here a-wondering : will that car pass my way
I'm going back to my baby : going back there to stay
I know my baby : is bound to love me some
She throws her arms around me : like the circle around the sun

I told the ticket agent : don't let your window down
I'm sick and blue : but I'm Frisco bound
Well a mean old fireman : a cruel old engineer
That would leave big fat Billiken : *walking along out there*

Wild jack on the mountain : and he brays the whole day long
Going to find me some lumber : build that old jack a home
I'm going to build a stable : as long as he is tall
So I can hear my wild jack : every time he calls
You ought to see : this big black jack of mine
He can eat more corn : than I feel like frying
This big black jack : got mane just like a horse
Going to keep my wild jack : lock him in my stall
He's a big bad jack : and you can hear him all over town
Going to keep my wild jack : if I have to chain him down

Mr undertaker Mr undertaker : drop your hammer and saw
You take my baby to the cemetery : and don't bring her back no more
I'm going take my females : hang them on a single line
I'm going to count one two three four five : six seven eight and nine
Well I went to the graveyard : kneeled down by my baby to talk
I have to leave you to heaven : *oh my baby's do no wrong*

Bring me a nickel's worth of liver : a dime's worth of stew
Feed everybody : on ??? Avenue
Got a man upside one downside : one across the street
Got your eyes wide open : but you're sound asleep
Bring me a nickel's worth of liver : a dime's worth of grease
??? my man : he called all the police
Listen papa : don't give me none of your head
Keep on fooling : you'll be filled full of lead
When you see me worried : I'm thinking about my burnt liver
I'll kill you about him : and my hand won't even quiver

Ooh : tomorrow I may be far away
Don't try to dog me honey : sweet talk can't make me stay
Now if you get loaded baby : and think you want to go
Remember baby : you ain't no better than the man I had before
When I get drunk I'm evil : I don't know what to do
If I get my good chib : can get something good from you
Now the man I love : he's just about the heightth of me
I'm five foot two : Lord and that sweet man's five foot three

All this world's against me : I believe my baby is too
Ah my baby's against me : Lord I can tell by the way he do
Now the man I love : Lord he don't mean me no good
Takes all his good jelly : around all the whole neighborhood
Now if I was a Gypsy : Lord and I could read your mind
Then I wouldn't have to wonder : where you spend all your time

I wake up every morning : with the rising sun
Oh thinking about my honeydripper : and all the wrongs he done
Oh he treats me mean : [only, just] comes to see me sometime
But the way he spreads his honey : Lord it makes me think I'll lose my mind
Oh because I'm brown : Lord he wants to drive me away
He knows he's a good honeydripper : Lord and I want him every day
Lord the man I love : oh Lord he really made me fall
Oh the way he drips his honey : Lord he won my heart that's all
Oh sometimes I feel so lonesome : Lord I don't know where to go
When my love comes down babe : I'll need you more than you'll ever know
Because he's a real sweet man : and I [want to lease him, got to sign him up] for ninety-nine years
That's what it takes to ease my mind : and stop all my tears

If you be my kid : I'll be your teddy bear
I'll get in your pocket : and follow you everywhere
When you see me coming : heist your window high
See me leaving : hand your head and cry

It's raining here : storming on the sea
I'm leaving here : but I sure don't want to go
*Thieving* man : don't want me no more
I'm going to town : I'm going to buy me a bed
Sleep with my man : if it kills me dead

Oh I ain't got : no easy rider now
The man I love : sure done turned me down
He treats me : like I'm some old body's dog
I ain't no dog : please don't dog me around
Oh your time now : be mine after a while
Give me my fare : I sure will leave this town
I'm going home : I ain't been home in so long
Going back to Georgia : if I don't stay long
Wonder what's the matter : I can't get no mail
Believe to my soul : they got my man in jail
Going to buy me a pistol : with a great long shiny barrel
When I'm dead : give it to my faro
Get your one man : you sure better get you two
Ain't no telling : what these men will do
I'm going away : just to wear you off my mind
Keep me worried : bothered all the time

I ain't going to marry : and I ain't going to settle down
I'm going to do like a pimp : I'm going to walk all around this town
Goodbye whiskey : sure don't worry me
I can get just as drunk : as any drunken man can be
My baby's gone : she didn't tell me because
If she don't come back : I am going to starve
Ever since : my baby's been gone away
I've been raggedy and dirty : haven't got no place to stay
My old gal : came into town last night
She didn't have no money : but she was too tight
Me and my gal : are going to make everything all right
If we don't today : we will tomorrow night

Oh mercy dear : you cause my heart
*Sad and long* : *with how to win my part*
I learn to love you : most all the rest
You're leaving me : wrecking happiness
I'll count the hours : *living when alone*
Think of you : when you back home
My lonesome heart : will shake with fear
The very hour : that you call my name
Minnie every hour : is a living fear
For I'm not at ease : with anyone else
I'll hunger long : for you evermore
I'm asking you dear : please don't go
Going to tell you this : ain't going to tell no lie
Day you leave me : that's the day you die

Don't want no woman : have to give my money to

I tried hard baby : did the very best I could

I'm going to the mountain : hold up my right hand

The girl I love : sings like a turtledove

That's the way baby : you have *things* to do

Every man that comes to see you : in this neighborhood
Keeps on buzzing to each other : that your clock ain't no good
Now your clock don't set : where it used to set before
It used to be on the *centre* : close to your back door

I was lying down dreaming : when the blues eased up on me
I was feeling so blue : down-hearted as could be
A brownskin gal : makes a bulldog bark with pain
And a bow-legged mama : make a snail catch a passenger train
Now you can always tell : when your woman treats you mean
I say your meals are never ready : and your house ain't never clean
She will come downstairs : a towel was tied around her head
You'll ask her for loving : she'll swear she's almost dead

I left my baby : standing in the doorway crying
She said daddy you've got a home : just as long as I got mine
My mama told me : papa told me too
Some day son : candy's going to be the death of you
Now it's chocolate candy : till my dying day
The same old candy : is going to carry me away
I've got one good woman : trying to make it four
When one pretty woman quits me : I'll have three more

I had the blues last night : I've got them again today
My man told me : he was going away
Trouble trouble : is all I can see
Look like my man : has turned his back on me
Just let me tell you : what your friends will do
Grin in your face : and then they'll talk about you
Me and my girl friend : went out for a little run
When she seen my man : she told him what I had done
Bring me a pint of whiskey : and a bottle of beer
If I get drunk : I sure don't care
Take me back baby : try me one more time
I do everything : to satisfy your mind
Listen people : to what I'm telling you
Don't let your left hand : know what your right hand do

I woke up this morning : with the blues all around my bed
I felt just like : somebody in my family was dead
I began to moan : and I began to cry
My sweet man went away : you know the reason why
If you don't like my sweet potato : what made you dig so deep
You in my potato field : three or four times a week
Whooping I've been whooping : whooping all night long
Whooping I've been whooping : ever since my man been gone
My dog got the rabbit : the rabbit fell down on his knees
He looked up at the dog : he say won't you have mercy on me please
Just as sure : as you hear me sing this song
You never miss your jelly : till your jellyroller's gone

Play that thing : play that thing just right
We got to scuffle : that house rent tonight
My house rent's due : my gas going up to ten
I wouldn't have no lights : but the lightman couldn't get in

I want all you people : to listen to my song
Remember me : after the days I'm gone

The storm is rising : the rains begin to fall
I'm all alone by myself : no one to love me at all
My blues at midnight : and don't leave me until day
I've got no sweet woman : to drive my blues away
Blues : falling like showers of rain
Every once in a while : think I hear my baby call my name

I'm lonesome as I can be : baby please come home to me
Because you know I love you : and how come we can't agree
You been gone the whole night long : I believe to my soul something going on wrong
But there will come a day : and I know you will be glad to say
I tried to please your mind : and you keep me worried all the time
You will either run me crazy : or I'll lose my mind
You know you don't treat me right : when you stay out both day and night
And I must stop you now : because you got to consider somehow
You know I love you now : and I love you all along
Although you my sweet woman : and I mean you can't go wrong

I was sitting in my kitchen : looking way out across the sky
I thought the world was ending : I started to cry
The wind was howling : the buildings begin to fall
I seen that mean old twister coming : just like a cannonball
The world was black as midnight : I never heard such a noise before
Sound like a million lions : when they turn loose their roar
Poor people was screaming : and running every which a-way
I fell down on my knees : I started in to pray
The shack where we was living : she reel and rock but never fell
How the cyclone spared us : nobody but the Lord can tell

It's raining and storming on the sea : we're miles and miles from shore
The way the waves is rocking this ship : we won't see home no more
The wind is so strong : turning this old ship round and round
Something tells me : won't be long before we're sinking down
The captain say get your lifesavers : fasten them around your waist
Because we're sinking down : and the lifeboat is your safest place
Uncle Sam's ship was coming : painted in red white and blue
We say we live in New York City : red white and blue brought us all the way through

Mmm : I feel myself sinking down
My body is freezing : I feel something cold creeping around
My windows is rattling : my doorknob turning round and round
This haunted house blues is killing me : I feel myself sinking down
I been fastened in this haunted house : six long months today
The blue ghost has got the house surrounded : Lord and I can't get away
They got shotguns and pistols : standing all around my door
They haunt me all night long : so I can't sleep no more
The blue ghost haunts me all night : the nightmare ride me all night long
They worry me so in this haunted house : I wish I was dead and gone

I went down to the levee : and [over, out] to the freight house yard
They paid a dollar an hour : but the work was too long and hard
Have pigtails in my pantry : neckbones on my shelf
I ain't got none to give you : I got just enough for myself
I'm going to buy me a shotgun : long as I am tall
I'm going to shoot my woman : just to see her fall
Over yonder's the river : yonder is your big lake
At your house rent party : you made your last mistake
I chew my bacca : and I spit my juice
I tried to love you so hard : but I found out there's no use

Although we are drifting : so far apart
My arms may be empty : have not give up in my heart
Although we are drifting : so far apart
My arms may be empty : but never down in my heart

Look down look down : that long old lonesome road
And look up to the good Lord : just before you go
That's a long that's a long : a long old tiresome road
You'll find troubles and worries : that you never found before
Then look back look back : and see what you're leaving all alone
To grieve and worry : after the days you gone
Then your days begin dreary : down that long old lonesome road
And you want the Lord have mercy : how much more further I've got to go
That's a long old road : a long road that has no end
Then the blues will make you think : about all your right-hand friends

Something keep a-moaning : I don't know what it is

When my right eye winks : on my knees I begin to crawl
It will be hell to tell the captain : if I catch another man kicking in my stall
There's no use a-worrying : baby about the days being long
The black snake is got the dough : you can't roll him from home

They tell me blues and trouble : walk hand in hand
But you ain't had no trouble : till your woman falls for some no-good man
A married woman will swear : she'll love you all her life
And meet her other man around the corner : and tell the same lie twice
You tell me you've had troubles : and worry all your life
Man but you ain't had no trouble : till you fall for another man's wife
Then if you get a woman of your own : and make her happy night and day
There will be some no-good man she'll fall for : pretty soon she'll go away
When it begin raining : and you're looking through your windowpane
And crazy about another man's wife : it's enough to drive you insane
But a married woman : is the sweetest woman ever was born
Only thing that hurts you : she have to go home sometime

I been lonesome all day : I've been grieving all night long
Baby please hear my plea : why don't you come back home
How many times : have I cried all night long
You know I must love you baby : when I beg you to come back home
I'll get a job in the coal yard : work in the rain and snow
All I ask you baby : please don't leave me no more

Sam you say you my friend : but your ways I just don't like
Soon as I leave my home : you trying to bite me in my back
Now Sam you not my friend : and my home you better stop hanging around
Because I've paid for your coffin : and I mean that you graveyard bound
Sam if you want a woman go get one : and let my wife alone
Because if I ever catch you with my wife : you hell bound sure as I'm born
Sam a real man can live happy : but no-good men like you
You trying to wreck my family : and some other man's family too
Sam I thought you was my friend : I thought you just was swell
So I'm going to give you a vacation : that's a round-trip ticket to hell

Now she ain't good-looking : she don't dress fine
The way that gal can love : change any man's mind
Now she bake good jellyroll : she bakes it nice and hot
It never fails : to touch the spot
If I was sentenced to be hung : and this ain't no lie
If I could just see my baby : I would be willing to die
Now my gal is built : long and tall
Lord when she starts to loving : I can't help from to fall
She likes her music soft : when the lights are low
When she starts to kiss me : does me good down in my toes
When I met my gal : she was dumb as dumb could be
But I believe to my soul : she put that thing on me

If you got over fifteen grand : better split it ninety-nine different ways
Because the racketeers : got no certain place to dig your grave
When they demand your money : you got to give it up with a smile
And if you refuse : they'll read about you in a short little while
When the gang is out to get you : it don't do no good to run
It's true you can dodge the law : but you can't dodge them slugs out the machine gun
You [slave, work] hard for your money : just to give it to some other one
And if you refuse : the answer will be from a racketeer's gun
When the gang is out to get you : they'll follow you everywhere
You can even move to West Hell : doggone if they don't find you there

You've got a hatchet under your pillow baby : you got ice pick in your hand
The best thing you better do : is find you another man
You've got a shotgun in the corner : blackjack under your bed
But you'll never catch me asleep : I know you wants to whip my head
You put lice all in my gravy : black potash in my tea
But I fed it to your man baby : instead of me
That's the very reason why : you been so mean to me
Trying to steal my life : to have your old used-to-be

People is [raving, hollering] about hard times : tell me what it's all about
Hard times don't worry me : I was broke when it first started out
Friends it could be worser : you don't seem to understand
Some is crying with a sack of gold under each arm : and a loaf of bread in each hand
If you're a single man : you better drink and have your fun
Because when that lovebug bites you : then your worries ain't never  done
People raving about hard times : I don't know why they should
If some people was like me : they didn't have no money when times was good

It's been snowing forty days and nights : lakes and rivers begin to freeze
Some places through my old home town : water's up above my knees
Storm begin rising : and the sun begin sinking down
I says mother and dad pack your trunk : we ain't safe here in this town
When it lightning my mind gets frightened : my nerves begin weaken down
And the shack where we was living : begin moving around
Women and children were screaming : saying mama where must we go
The flood water have broke the levee : and we ain't safe here no more

You see it ain't what you used to be baby : it's what you are today
You see your good looks didn't hold your man : a little black gal's loving stole your man away
I've got a woman now that I love : better than I love myself
She treats me so cold sometimes : I think she got somebody else

You arms don't feel the same : your lips is icebox cold
It's a mean black snake : is making his morning stroll
You know : you once was the sweetest woman I ever found
But since you been running out with your girl friend : you just a plain old everyday clown

If love is a crime then I'm guilty : but there's nothing I can do
After all the good women in this world : why did I have to fall in love with you

Don't the world seem lonely : when you got to battle it all by yourself
Even the one you love : turn their back on you for someone else
My mother and dad left me : when I was too small to help myself
And my sisters and brothers : drove me away to somebody else
I'm motherless and I'm fatherless : I'm almost friendless too
Seems the world is down on you : know knows what to do
Rocks was my pillow : and the cold ground was my bed
The blue skies was my blanket : and the moonlight was my spread

Good morning blues : where have you been so long
I just stopped by to leave you enough of worries : to last you while I'm gone
My brains is cloudy : my soul is upside down
When I get that lowdown feeling : I know the blues must be somewhere close around
The blues is like the devil : it comes on you like a spell
Blues will leave your heart full of trouble : and your poor mind full of hell
Some people say that's no blues : but that story's old and stale
The blues will drive you to drink and murder : and spend the rest of your life in jail
The blues and the devil : is your closest friend
The blues will leave you with murder in your mind : that's when the devil out of hell steps in

I work all day long for you : until the sun go down
And you take all my money and drink it up : and come home and wants to fuss and clown
It hurts to love a person : that don't belong to you
Because when they find out that you really love them : and they don't care what they do
They'll take your heart and they'll use it : like a football on a football ground
And when they get through playing with your heart : and they'll start dragging you all around

Want all of you people to listen : while my guitar sings
If you ain't got that rhythm : it don't mean a thing
Some people thinks I'm dead : because I've been gone so long
I just stop to see : would you miss me from singing these lonesome songs
I want all you people to listen : while I swing this song
If you were born with that rhythm : honest you can't never go wrong

Storm is rising : and the rain begin to fall
Trouble is breaking down my window : blues breaking down my door
My blues started at sunrise : and rides me all through the day
It takes the sweet woman I love : to drive these blues away
Come into my arms sweet woman : and please explain yourself to me
Tell me who do you really want : or do you still want your used-to-be
Because sometimes you with me : baby then again you gone
If you want your used-to-be : then you better let me alone
Blues : falling like showers of rain
Every once in a while : I can hear my baby call my name

I've been drinking all night long : I've started again today
I been trying my best : to drink these worried blues away
Some people drinks to hide their [worries and] troubles : but that don't mean a thing
When you think your troubles are gone : and you find yourself drunk again
Friends I drink to keep from worrying : I smile to keep from crying
That's why I cover my troubles : so the public don't know what's on my mind
I said I was through with love : both whiskey wine and gin
You know when I found myself : I was lap-legged drunk again
Love will make a-many man drink and gamble : and stay out all night long
Love will drive you to many places : sometimes where you don't belong

Mmm : something cold is creeping around
Blue ghost has got me : I feel myself sinking down
Black cat and an owl : come to keep me company
They understands my troubles : mmm and sympathize with me
I been in this haunted house : for three long years today
Blue ghost has got my shack surrounded : oh Lord and I can't get away
I feel cold arms around me : and ice lips upon my cheek
My lover is dead : how plainly plainly I can hear her speak
My windows begin rattling : and my doorknob is turning around and around
My lover's ghost has got me : and I know my time won't be long

It's been snowing forty days : and the ground is covered with snow
I'm snow-bound in my cabin : and ice up around my door
I woke up this morning : couldn't even get out my door
I was snowbound in my cabin : had water seeping up through my floor
Snow begin melting : and the rain begin to fall
The backwaters done broke the levee : and I can't stay here no more
Rowed my boat : just about four miles across the pond
Backwater done wrecked my cabin : and there's no place that I can call my home

What makes the rooster : crow every morning before day
To let the pimps know : that the workingman is on his way
We're up before sunrise : slaving sixteen hours a day
We pay our house rent and grocery bills : and the pimps get the rest of our pay
Men can't you see : you can't keep a whole woman by yourself
If your best friend can't get your woman : he'll frame her for somebody else
Something about some women : that I never could understand
They're not satisfied with a good husband : they want some other woman's man

I woke up this morning : blues all around my bed
I never had no good man : I mean to ease my aching head
Well : pretty near all night long
Well I swear before God : the man I'm loving is doing wrong
Well I'm going away : swear the time ain't long
If you don't believe I'm leaving daddy : count them days I'm gone
You done caused me to weep baby : and I swear you done caused me to moan
Well you know by that rider : that I ain't going to be here long
Well : what evil have I done
Well it must be something : my man have heard before he gone
Lord I'm going to get drunk : and I'm going to walk the streets all night
Because the man that I'm loving : I swear he sure don't treat me right

Lord I woke up this morning : blues all around my bed
I never had no good man : I mean to ease my worried head
Now now now now now : I cried like a newborn child
Lord even when I was a baby : I wasn't satisfied
Well I'm going I'm going : daddy to wear you off my mind
Because you keeps me worried baby : and troubled all the time
I said Lord have mercy : I mean Lord have mercy on me
I said Lord have mercy : mercy's all I need
Lord ??? : and I fell down on my knees
Well I done cried I cried : Lord have mercy on me

Well I'm going to Memphis : come to stop at Cincinnat'
I'm going to tell you women : how to treat a man
I said now you ain't good-looking : and you don't dress fine
That kind of treatment : make me ??? you most any old time
Well I'm going to Memphis : stop at *Satches* hall
Going to tell you women : how to cock it on the wall
Now you can snatch it you can break it : you can hang it on the wall
Throw it out the window : see if you catch it before it fall
Well I'm going to leave here :

??? : I saw the moon go down
And I swear my man must be somewhere : turning around and around
I say the big star are falling : it don't be long before day
The moon *want* my baby : ??? mighty far away
I'm going to wake up : between midnight and day
You going to ??? *my need* baby : and I swear I'll be gone away
Now won't you come here baby : sit down on my knee
Now I just want to tell you : black man how you have treated me

You said you's going to leave me : but I don't care
You thought the way I treated you : wasn't fair
You went and told somebody : you thought I wouldn't do
But if you think you'll get away with it : I'll sing this verse to you
Because if I let you get away with it once : you'll do it all the time
Now if you think I'm going crazy about you : you'd better change your mind
You promised me once : you wouldn't cheat anymore
But had a dozen keys : to fit my back door
You crept away : to see a movie show today
But when you came home : you didn't know the name of the play

Blow whistle : my stomach say it's eating time
My appetite is worth a million : and just got a measly dime
It's Saturday night : and I'm higher than a Georgia pine
One more drink of corn : and I'll leave my Georgia mind
When a gator holler : folks say it's a sign of rain
The weather's getting cloudy Lord : how these *birdies sing*

I got a barrelhouse flat in *Eastport* : and one I St Louis too
But my barrelhouse flat in *Eastport* : really get *my ???*
I'm going to build me a barrelhouse flat : way out on Dago Hill
Where I can get my beer and whiskey : and it's fresh from the still
I got a barrelhouse flat in Chicago : it's fifteen stories high
I get all of these high yellows : and play these *crazy dice*
Those ??? like my good whiskey : and they drink my cherry wine
If you women want a good time : stop by this barrelhouse flat of mine

My man's in the mountain : and I've got the mountain key
If you want to see my man : you got to come to me
Mmm he was my man : before you women ever knew his name
And you know by that : you got to see me just the same
If you women wants a good man : find one of your own
For this man is my man : I want you women to leave my man alone
Now I have no place : for you women you see
Oh my man's in the mountain : and I've got the mountain key

Rattlesnake treating papa : what makes you treat your mama so mean
You know that your mama loves you : that's why you treat me like you do
You treats me like a rattlesnake : crawling on the ground
The better I try to treat you : the more you throw your mama down
Ah that's all right : daddy that's all right for you
Some day you'll want poor Mary : and she'll be somewhere from you
Oh rattlesnake crawling daddy : you know you doing me wrong
I'm looking for you baby : and you crawling around some other person's home
You dog me all in the morning : and dog me late at night
And I can tell by that : you ain't treating your mama right

I once was a married woman : sorry the day I ever was
I was a young girl at home : and I did not know the world
I'd rather be an old maid : than to be worried and blue each and every day
Because these worrisome old men : will cause your head to turn white and grey
Babe you caused me to leave my happy home : and you caused me to weep and moan
That is why babe : this bad luck's taking place today
I was just sitting here thinking : baby just a minute ago
I once was a married woman : sorry the day I ever was

I got a kind-hearted woman : do anything in this world for me
But these evil-hearted women : man they will not let me be
I love my baby : my baby don't love me
But I really love that woman : can't stand to leave her be
Now ain't but the one thing : makes Mr Johnson drink
That's worry about how you treat me baby : I begin to think
Oh babe : my life don't feel the same
You breaks my heart : when you call Mr so-and-so's name
She's a kind-hearted woman : she studies evil all the time
You have to kill me : just to have it on your mind

I got a kind-hearted mama : do anything in this world for me
But these evil-hearted women : man they will not let me be
I love my baby : and my baby don't love me
I really love that woman : can't stand to leave her be
Now it ain't but one thing : make Mr Johnson drink
I get worried about how you treat me baby : I begin to think
Oh babe : my life don't feel the same
You breaks my heart : when you call Mr so-and-so's name
She's a kind-hearted [mama, woman] : [but she] studies evil all the time
You have to kill me baby : just to have it on your mind
Some day some day : I will shake your hand goodbye
I can't give any more of my loving : because I just ain't satisfied

I'm going to get up in the morning : I believe I'll dust my broom
Because then the black man you been loving : girl friend can get my room
I'm going to write a letter : telephone every town I know
If I can't find her in West Selma : she must be in East Monroe I know
I don't want no woman : wants every downtown man she meet
She's a no-good dony : they shouldn't allow her on the street
I believe : I believe I'll go back home
If you mistreat me here babe : but you can't when I go home
I'm going to call up China : see is my good girl over there
If I can't find her on Philippines Island : she must be in Ethiopia somewhere

Ooh : baby don't you want to go
Back to the land of California : to my sweet home Chicago
Now one and one is two : three and two is four
I'm heavy loaded baby : I'm booked I've got to go
Now two and two is four : four and two is six
You going to keep on monkeying around here *pin boy* : you going to get your ??? in a fix
Now six and two is eight : eight and two is ten
His wife get tricky one time : she sure going to do it again
I'm going to California : *some passing in my byway*
Somebody will tell me : that you need my help some day

I got rambling : I got rambling [all] on my mind
Hate to leave my baby : but she treats me so unkind
Running down to the station : catch [that old, the] first mail train I see
I got the blues about Miss so-and-so : and the child got the blues about me
And I'm leaving this morning : with my arms folded up and crying
I hate to leave my baby : but she treats me so unkind

When you got a good friend : have her stay right by your side
Give her all of your spare time : love and treat her right
I mistreated my baby : [but, and] I can't see no reason why
Any time I think about it : I just wring my hands and cry
Wonder could I ever apologize : or will she fisty-fight with me
She's a brownskin woman : just as sweet as a girl friend can be
Baby *do you think it mmm* : oh I may be right or wrong
Got you a close friend baby : then your enemies can't do you no harm

Mmm : mmm
You better come on in my kitchen : well it's going to be raining outdoors
The woman I love : took from my best friend
Some joker got lucky : stoled her back again
Oh oh she's gone : I know she won't come back
I taken her last nickel : out of her nation sack
When a woman gets in trouble : everybody throws her down
Looking for her good friends : none can be found
And the time coming : it's going to be so
You can't make the winter babe : just dry long so

Well I feel so lonesome : you hear me when I moan
Who's been driving my terraplane for you : since I've been gone

Got a short in this connection : hoo well babe and it's way down below
I'm going heist your hood mama : I'm bound to check your oil

Now you know the coils ain't even buzzing : little generator won't get the spark
Motor's in a bad condition : you got to have these batteries charged
I'm crying please : please don't do me wrong
Who's been driving my terraplane : now for you since I've been gone
Mr highwayman : please don't block the road
Because she's registering a cold one hundred : and I'm booked till I got to go
Eee : you can hear me weep and moan
Who's been driving my terraplane now for you : since I've been gone
I'm going to get deep down in this connection : keep on tangling with your wires
And when I mash down on your little starter : then your spark plug will give me fire

Yeah but she got a phonograph : but it won't say a lonesome word
What evil have I done : what evil has the poor girl heard
Yeah but I love my phonograph : but she have broke my winding chain
And you've taken my loving : and given it to your other man
Now we played it on the sofa now : we played it side the wall
My needles have got rusty baby : it will now play at all
Yeah but if I go crazy : baby I will lose my mind
I can bring your clothes back home : and try me one more time

If I send for my baby : and she don't come
All the doctors in [Hot Springs, Westmount] : sure can't help her none
And if she gets unruly : things she don't want to do
Take my thirty-two twenty : and I can cut her half in two
She got a thirty-eight special : but I believe it's most too light
I got a thirty-two twenty : got to make the camps all right
I'm going to shoot my pistol : going to shoot my gatling gun
You made me love you : now your man done come

You didn't come home : till the sun was shining bright
Ooh : boys I just can't take my rest
With this thirty-two twenty : laying up and down my breast

She sleeps in the kitchen : with her feets in the hall
She got two for a nickel : got four for a dime
It's worth paying more : but they ain't none of mine
I got a letter : from my girl in the room
Now she got something good : she got to bring it home soon
The billygoat backed : in the bumblebee's nest
Ever since that : he can't take his rest

I due to break away your liver : and tear your heart to piece
You know grandma left me : now grandpa too
Well I wonder what in the world : we children going to do
Me and my baby : bought a V-Eight Ford
Well they ride that thing : all on the running board
You know the monkey now the baboon : playing in the grass
Well the monkey said to *fatto* : *good luck gas*

I woke up this morning : and all my shrimps was dead and gone
I was thinking about you baby : will you hear me weep and moan
I got dead shrimps here : someone is fishing in my pond
I've sold you my best bait baby : and I can't do that no more
Everything I do baby : you got your mouth stuck out
Hole where I used to fish : you got me forced out
I got dead shrimps here : someone's fishing in my pond
Catching my goggle-eyed perches : and they barbecuing the bones
Now you taken my shrimp baby : you know you turned me down
I couldn't do nothing : until I got myself unwound

I went to the crossroads : fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above have mercy : save poor Bob if you please
Mmm standing at the crossroads : I tried to flag a ride
Didn't nobody seem to know me : everybody passed me by
Mmm the sun going down boys : not going to catch me here
I haven't got no loving sweet woman : but not to feel my care
You can run you can run : tell my friend boy Willie Brown
Lord that I'm standing at the crossroad baby : I believe I'm sinking down

I woke up this morning : feeling around for my shoes
Know by that : I got these old walking blues
Lord I feel like blowing : my poor lonesome horn
Got up this morning : my little Berniece was gone
Lord I feel like blow : my lonesome horn
Well I got up this morning : all I had was gone
Well leaving this morning : if I have to oh ride the blinds
I feel mistreated : and I don't mind dying
Leaving this morning : I have to ride the blinds
Babe I been mistreated : baby and I don't mind dying
Well some people tell me : that the worried blues ain't bad
Worst old feeling : I most ever had
She's got Elgin movements : from her head down to her toes
Break in on a dollar : most anywhere she goes

If you cry about a nickel : you die about a dime
She wouldn't cry : but the money ain't mine

I got up this morning : the blues walking like a man
Worried blues : give me your right hand
Blues grabbed mama's child : and it tore me all upside down
Travel on poor Bob : just can't turn you around
The blues : is a lowdown shaking chill
You ain't never had them : I hope you never will
Well the blues : is a aching old heart disease
Like consumption : killing me by degrees
Now if it's starting a-raining : I'm going to drive my blues away
Going to the ??? : stay out there all day

If I had possession : over Judgment Day
Lord the little woman I'm loving : wouldn't have no right to pray
I went to the mountain : look as far as my eyes could see
Saw where the man got my woman : and lonesome blues got me
And I rolled and I tumbled : and I cried the whole night long
When I woke up this morning : my biscuit-roller's gone
Had to fold my arms : and I slowly walked away
I said in my mind : your trouble going to come some day
Now run here baby : set down on my knee
I want to tell you : all about the way they treated me

I got stones in my passway : and my road seem dark as night
I have pains in my heart : they have taken my appetite
I have a bird to whistle : and I have a bird to sing
I got a woman that I'm loving : boy but she don't mean a thing
My innocence betrayed me : have overtaken poor Bob at last
And that's one thing certain : they have stones all in my pass
Now you trying to take my life : and all my loving too
You laid a passway for me : now what are you trying to do
I'm crying please : please let us be friends
And when you hear me howling in my passway rider : please open your door and let me in
I got three legs to truck on : boys please don't block my road
I been feeling ashamed about my rider : babe I'm booked and I got to go

I'm a steady rolling man : I roll both night and day
But I haven't got no sweet woman : mmm boys to be rolling this a-way
I'm the man that rolls : when icicles hanging on the tree
And now you hear me howling : baby mmm down on my bended knee
I am a hard-working man : have been for many years I know
And some cream puff's using my money : ooo well well babe but that'll never be no more
You can't give your sweet woman : everything she wants in one time
Well boys she get rambling in her brain : mmm some other man on her mind

From four until late : I was wringing my hands and crying
I believe to my soul : that your daddy's going fall down
From Memphis to Norfolk : is a thirty-six hour's ride
A man is like a prisoner : and he's never satisfied
A woman is like a dresser : with a man always rambling through its drawers
It caused so many men : wear an apron overall
From four until late : she give us a no-good bunching clown
Now she won't do nothing : but tear a good man's reputation down
When I leave this town : I'm going to bid you fare farewell
And when I return again : you'll have a great long story to tell

I've got to keep moving : blues falling down like hail
And the days keep on worrying me : there's a hellhound on my trail
If today was Christmas Eve : and tomorrow was Christmas Day
All I would need my little sweet rider : just to pass the time away
You sprinkled hot-foot powder : mmm around my door
It keeps me with a rambling mind rider : every old place I go
I can tell the wind is rising : the leaves trembling on the trees
All I need my little sweet woman : and to keep my company

Mmm she is a little queen of spades : and the men will not let her be
Every time she makes a spread : a cold chill runs all over me
Well I'm going to get me a gambling woman : the last thing that I do
A man don't need a woman : ooo fair brown he got to give all of his money to
And everybody say she got a mojo : [because she, baby you] been using that stuff
She got a way trimmering down : ooo well babe and I mean it's most too tough
Well well little girl says I'm the king : fair brown and you is the queen
Let's we put our heads together : ooo fair brown then we can make our money green

Now she is a little queen of spades : and the men will not let her be
Every time she makes a spread : ooo fair brown cold chills just runs all over me

Now little girl say I'm the king : baby and you is the queen
Let's us put our heads together : ooo fair brown then we can make our money green

I keep drinking malted milk : trying to drink my blues away
Baby you just as welcome to my loving : as the flowers is in may
Malted milk malted milk : keep rushing to my head
And I have a funny funny feeling : that I'm talking all out my head
Baby fix me one more drink : and hug your daddy one more time
Keep on spilling my malted milk mama : until I change my mind
My doorknob keeps on turning : it must be spooks around my bed
I have a warm old feeling : and the hair rising on my head

I'm a [poor] drunken-hearted man : my life seems so misery
And if I could only change my way of living : it would mean so much to me
I've been drunk and I've been driven : ever since I left my mother's home
And I can't see the reason why : that I can't leave these no-good womens alone
My poor father died and left me : and my mother done the best that she could
Every man loves that game you call love : but it don't mean no man no good
I'm a poor drunken-hearted man : and sin was the cause of it all
But the day you get weak for no-good women : that's the day that you surely fall

I'm a [poor] drunken-hearted man : my life seems so misery
And if I could only change my way of living : it would mean so much to me
I've been dogged and I've been driven : ever since I left my mother's home
And I can't see the reason why : that I can't leave these no-good womens alone
My poor father died and left me : and my mother done the best that she could
Every man loves that game you call love : but it don't mean no man no good
I'm the poor drunken-hearted man : and sin was the cause of it all
But the way you get weak for no-good women : that's the day that you surely fall

Early this morning : when you knocked upon my door
And I said hello Satan : I believe it's time to go
Me and the devil : was walking side by side
I'm going to beat my woman : until I get satisfied
She said you knows the way : that I always dog her around
It must've be that old evil spirit : so deep down in the ground
You may bury my body : down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit : can get a Greyhound bus and ride

Every time I'm walking : down the street
Some pretty mama : starts breaking down with me
Stop breaking down : yeah stop breaking down
The stuff I got about you breaking down : ooo it will make you lose your mind
I can't walk the streets : nor com- *compelate* my mind
Some no-good woman : she starts breaking down
Now you Saturday night women : you love to ape and clown
You won't do nothing : but tear a good man's reputation down
Now I gave my baby now : the ninety-nine degree
She jumped up : and throwed a pistol down on me
I can't start walking : down the street
When some pretty mama : starts breaking down on me

If your man gets personal : want to have your fun
Just come on back to Friar's Point mama : and barrelhouse all night long
I've got womens in Vicksburg : clean on into Tennessee
But my Friar's point rider now : hops all over me
I ain't going to state no color : but her front teeth crowned with gold
She got a mortgage on my body : and a lien on my soul

We can still barrelhouse baby : because it's on the riverside

Some day I will return : with a marriage license in my hand
I'm going to take you for a honeymoon : in some long long distant land

And I followed her to the station : with a suitcase in my hand
Well it's hard to tell it's hard to tell : when all your love's in vain
When the train rolled up to the station : I looked her in the eye
Well I was lonesome I felt so lonesome : and I could not help but cry
The train it left the station : with two lights on behind
Well the blue light was my blues : and the red light was my mind

I followed her to the station : with my suitcase in my hand
Well it's hard to tell it's hard to tell : when all your love's in vain
When the train rolled up to the station : and I looked her in the eye

When the train it left the station : with two lights on behind
Well the blue light was my blues : and the red light was my mind

I was born in the state : of old Arkansas
Where they don't allow : no Mississippi women there at all
I'm going I'm going : back to my old home to stay
And you'll find me : hanging around the levee both night and day
Then after I walk the levee : from end to end
I'll go to Sweet Mama Alley : go and get my hooch and gin
I've tried old jelly : and old *loosha* too
But me and my gin house liquor : well we sure can do
I don't see why : white folks don't have no blues
They got all kinds of money : and brownskin women too
When you go to Vicksburg : please ask for old dripper king
For he's the bootlegging fellow : your *turkey* sure can swing

I asked for water : and she gave me gasoline

Crying Lord I wonder : will I ever get back home

I went to the depot : looked up on the board
I asked the conductor : how long has this eastbound train been gone
It done taken your faro : blowed its smoke on you

Lord I asked the conductor : could I ride the blinds
Son buy your ticket buy your ticket : because the train ain't none of mine

Crying I ain't going down : this big road by myself
If I don't carry you : going to carry somebody else
Crying sun going to shine : in my back door some day
And the wind going to change : going to blow my blues away
What makes you do me : like you do do do
Now you think you going to do me : like you done poor Cherry Red
Taken the poor boy's money now : sure Lord won't take mine

Crying by-and-by : baby by-and-by

Says Good Book tell you : reap just what you sow
Going to reap it now : or baby reap it by-and-by
Well I'm going away : won't be back till fall
If I meet my good gal : then baby won't be back at all
Well it's two trains running : running side by side
You got my woman : babe I know you're satisfied

Mmm who's that yonder : coming down the road
Well it looks like Maggie : baby but she walks too slow
Mmm sun going to shine : in my back door some day
And the wind going to change : going to blow my blues away
Mmm see see rider : see what you done done
You done made me love you : now you're trying to put me down
Well I'm going away Lord : won't be back till fall
And if I meet my good gal : well I won't be back at all

Crying canned heat mama : sure Lord killing me
Takes alcorub : to take these canned heat blues
Crying mama mama mama : you know canned heat killing me
Canned heat don't kill me : crying babe I'll never die
I woke up up this morning : with canned heat on my mind

I woked up up this morning : crying canned heat around my bed
Run here somebody : take these canned heat blues
Crying mama mama mama : crying canned heat killing me
Believe to my soul : Lord it going to kill me dead

Won't you wash my jumper : starch my overalls
I'm going to find my woman : says she's in the world somewhere
Well it's good to you mama : sure Lord killing me

I wonder : do my rider think of [poor] me
Lord if she did : she would sure Lord feel my care
I woke up this morning : said my morning prayers

I ain't got no woman : speak in my behalf

Won't you wash my jumper : starch my overalls
I'm going to find my woman : says she's in this world somewhere
I wonder : do my good girl think of me
Crying if she did : she would sure Lord feel my care
Honey it's good to you : mama sure Lord killing me

I woke up this morning : said my morning prayers
I ain't got no woman : to speak in my behalf

Crying big fat mama : meat shaking on her bones
Time the meat shake : it's a sign a woman lose her home
Mmm going away mama : won't be back till fall
Big fat mama : with the meat shaking on her bones
Mmm no need to holler : I got to murmur low
Big fat mama : Lord meat shake on her bones
Mmm time meat shake : it's sign a fatmouth lose his home

Mmm what's the matter rider : where did you stay last night
Hair all down baby : and you won't treat me right

Mmm big fat mama : meat shaking on her bones

Lonesome place : don't seem like it's home to me

Lord I woke up this morning : blues all around my bed
Had the blues so bad mama : till I couldn't raise up my head
If you want to live easy : pack your clothes with mine

Mmm soon one morning : blues come falling down
Well they fell so heavy : that it caused my heart to moan
Well I'm going back home : going to fall down on my knees
Says I'll acknowledge now pretty baby : that I treated you mean

Hitch up my buggy : saddle up my black mare
Find my woman : because she's out in the world somewhere
Aah if I call you : and you will fail to come
If I call you mama : going to sure Lord call your name
I been drinking all night gal : did the night before
Been drunk baby : and I ain't got sober yet
Mmm : I ain't going to tell you no more
Told you last night mama : what I did the night before

Says you going to have : a rounder for your own

Woke up this morning : blues all around my bed
I didn't have my daddy : to hold my aching head
I know the blues ain't nothing : but a woman wants to see her man
Because every time my man leaves me : Lord knows I feel so bad
You can never tell : what's on a brownskin man's mind
He'll be hugging and kissing you : and quit you all the time

Early one morning : I set down in my door
Lord I sitting here wondering : where in the world can a good man go
I hear my rider hollering : way up on the hill
Said I know it's my rider : she got a voice like a whippoorwill
I'm going to get you a ticket : going to take you on away from here
Lord if you never come back : Lord I will never care
I'm going to write my name : up on my baby's back door
So she can see my name : if she never see me no more

I ain't got no money : nobody won't loan me none
Said I heard my rider was dead : and I sure want to get back home
If I had good luck Lord : like I once have had
Says I won't have to worry : about the trouble I had
I went to the graveyard : looked in my baby's face
Says I love you rider : but I can't take your place
The little boy's hollering extra : people did you read the news
Says I done killed my rider : and I got them Leavenworth blues

I tried to love you : way back on my young days
You were so evil-hearted : throwed all my good love away
Mmm : what's the matter now
But now you want to quit me : and you don't know how
I'm going down to the river : take me a rocking chair
If the blues overtake me : rock away from there

That mean T P [railroad, railway] : sure has done me wrong
It let that Sunshine Special : carry my good gal from home
The blues : come down like showers of rain
I couldn't see nothing : but smoke from that train
Every time I hear : that Sunshine Special blow
It makes me : want to pack up all my clothes and go

First night that I went home : drunk as I could be
There's another mule in the stable : where my mule ought to be
Come here honey : explain yourself to me
How come another mule in the stable : where my mule ought to be
Oh crazy oh silly : can't you plainly see
That's nothing but a milkcow : where your mule ought to be
I've traveled this world over : million times or more
Saddle on a milkcow's back : I've never seen before
Second night when I got home : as drunk as I could be
There's another coat on the coat rack : where my coat ought to be
Come here honey : explain this thing to me
How come another coat on the coat rack : where my coat ought to be
Oh crazy oh silly : can't you plainly see
Nothing but a bed quilt : where your coat ought to be
I've traveled this world over : million times or more
Pockets in a bed quilt : I've never seen before
The third night when I went home : drunk as I could be
There's another head on the pillow : where my head ought to be
Come here honey come here : explain this thing to me
How come another head on the pillow : where my head ought to be
Oh crazy oh silly : can't you plainly see
That's nothing but a cabbage head : that your grandma sent to me
I've traveled this world over : million times or more
Hair on a cabbage head : I've never seen before

I washes hard : both day and night
Catch you arguing with that fellow : you going to have a miserable fight
Ashes to ashes : dust to dust
The police don't get you : now the undertaker must

I was standing at the station : wondering what train boys must I ride
Lord I'm on my way down in Louisiana : I believe I'll wait here for the Katy Fly
My woman left me this morning : left me wondering all to myself
Lord she said she didn't love me no more boys : wonder do she love anybody else
Ain't but the two old roads : boys I did not want to ride
Lordy that Southern Pacific now boys : and you know the Katy Fly
I got the railroad blues bad : I got the boxcars on my running mind
Now every time I get to studying about my sweet woman : boys I can hardly keep from crying

Now I can remember my baby : it was late one Friday night
Now you know you mistreat me woman : you know you didn't do me right
I walked and I walked baby : I walked to see you both night and day
Oh now you know I give you my money baby : womans and I lets you have your doggone way
Farewell baby : you going to need my help again
Now you said that you didn't knowed that I was coming baby : you  wouldn't have even let me in
Now the troubles that I'm having : woman you was the cause of it all
Now you even had me down walking baby : I could hardly but crawl along

I'm going to buy me a pistol : hang it up side the wall
I'm going to stop that jellybean : from kicking in my stall
I got a long tall woman : she don't do nothing but run around
Every time I leave : she don't do nothing but mess around
My woman's got a new way of loving : a monkey-man can't catch on
When he knows anything : she done got his dollar and gone

I was shipwrecked on the ocean : throwed off on the southern sea
When you get to Chicago : pretty mama please remember me
I was standing beside the ocean : looking across on the other side
My woman got little bitty legs : but man what a noble thigh
I went down to the ocean : just to get a permanent wave
My woman got a new way of loving : man and it won't behave
When it storms on the ocean : you cannot see the sky
If I don't love you pretty mama : I will pray to die

I got a woman in Dallas : got one in San Antone too
I pick this one in San Antone : I don't know what this poor girl in Dallas going to do
She got nine gold teeth people : all that wavy hair
And if you ever come in San Antone : you going to find my sweet woman there
I never mistreated my baby : boy but I do wrong myself
For if I be mean to my woman : she will really quit and take someone else
Mmm baby : oh don't you think I know
Said I want to make an end of her people : and shake hands and go
I went to bed last night : I rolled from side to side
Honey I didn't have no blues really : but things wasn't going on right
I want someone to tell me : oh what Lord have mercy means
So if it means anything : well Lord have mercy on me
I'm going back to Dallas : oh don't you want to go
Honey I'm going to stop in towns : I believe that I haven't never been before

I said listen baby : honey I can't move no more
Oh these blues crawling up my windows : and traveling up under my door
Some womens weeps like a willow : some only sack of dough
But your life in misery : the minute that you ain't with the woman you love
Mmm : mmm
Lord it's something telling me : keeps on troubling me
Will you please tell the judge : don't have a trial till June
Because I got a working baby : let me see what my woman can do
People here she come in the evening : honey hundred in her hand
She had done robbed some fatmouth : who really looking for her man
Tell me sweet baby : honey what's on your mind
You keep a poor man troubled : really looking down-hearted all the time
Mmm baby : honey don't you think I know
Said I wouldn't make a man love her : if he wouldn't shake hands and go
Lord I'm going to Louisiana : going to get me a hoodoo hand
I'm going to stop my woman : and fix it so she can't have another man

Mr Ferris Mr Ferris : let your womenfolks go
I done trying to get my sweet woman : like Mr Ferris got his girl
Mmm : baby don't you think I know
Pretty woman like a man : love him people and shake hands and go
No you never take a woman : speaking about to be your friend
Oh she get all of your money : then look what a hole you're in
I went to bed last night : keep a-rolling from side to side
I didn't have no blues : understand that things wasn't going right
When you catch me sleeping : baby don't you think I'm drunk
I's a-got one on the dresser : keep the other one on your trunk
Tell me sweet baby : all what's on your mind
You keep a poor man troubled : really looking down-hearted all the time

I know this eagle's on a dollar : other side In God We Trust
Well a woman loves a man : but I know this dollar's first
Have you ever loved a woman : man that didn't love you
Then you have the worried blues : to bother you the whole night through
Well I'm going sweet baby : honey don't you want to go
Well I may stop in town : where I haven't never been before
Sometime you hear me singing : Nearer My God To Thee
Then again you hear me singing : sweet Atlanta blues to you

Oh the train pass by : oh with my sweet baby inside
And when I looked up and seen her : couldn't help but hang my head and cry
She gets her water at *Fairman* : coal at *Shabama Mines*
And I wouldn't let everybody ride : but people you know the train ain't mine
I said good morning conductor : oh please let a broke man ride
Because I want to see my sweet woman : just one more time before she get on
Said I'm tired of hearing me singing : Our Father Kingdom Come
Another year you hear me moaning : Lord let Thy will be done

I remember one time people : oh it is in nineteen and twenty-four
Something happened that year : that I never want to see no more
I remember one time : oh it is in nineteen twenty-one
They say I got to watch my sweet woman : she's running from sun to sun
I thought : that my woman oh was treating me right
But oh when I went down to call for her : she didn't do nothing but fuss and fight
I never earned nothing : oh so much to hurt me so
Oh when I was talking to my babe that morning : and she told me that I didn't
Mmm : baby what's on your mind
Oh you want to be mean to me woman : give me a good word all the time

Well I'm leaving sweet baby : can't carry you
Well I'm leaving sweet baby : don't you want to go
Well I tried to love a sweet mama : but she couldn't understand
But I know she realized the trouble : since she met another man

I say you got a sweet woman : man which you just don't understand
The man needs to take you women : and move across the no man's land
Mmm : ain't going to [sing, blow] no more
Blues done called up my woman : and traveled her and brought her up to my door
I want you to take me on with you baby : let you ease me down across your bed
I want you talk baby-talk to me : and then suck my tongue cherry red

Just as sure as the train come in San Antone : then ease up in the yard
It's going to take two dollars and a quarter : I declare to send me a postal card
Mmm baby : oh honey what's on your mind
Because you really keeps me troubled : and I think about you all the time
I'm going to move to the bottom : camp out on the ground
Every morning I'll call my woman : to see have my coat found
I got a woman in San Antone : I declare that is sweet to me
Because the people don't know she's here : but she lives on Cherry Street
Mmm : Lord Lord Lordy Lord
I want Eddie Duncan : listen to be my brother-in-law
Well I'll tell you men something : know you ain't going to think it's so

Four-flushing papa : what kind of man is you
Four-flushing papa : you thrill me through and through
I've never been crazy : about men
Who ain't done no strutting : since the Lord knows when
Four-flushing papa : what have you done to me
Because when you leave me : I'm blue as blue can be
Now when I get a payday : I don't have no plans
Keep a quarter for myself : have to give to my man
Now when I get a payday : right to you I go
You take it all papa : because it's all yours

I got the blues : blue as blue can be
Because these no-good gals : trying to backbite me
Now these backbiters : don't live long I'm told
So you'd better watch out : doggone your bad-luck soul
Just let your conscience : be your safety guide
*Anything wrong* with me : *is a mitten to a side*
It's one more thing : I can't understand
Why these trifling gals : run after a good gal's man
Take my advice : and please don't lose your head
If you take my man : sure going to wake up dead

Every time : I see a railroad track
Feel like riding : feel like going back
Catch a train : that's headed for the South
Going back south : to get smacked in the mouth
Got a man : way down old Texas way
Going to meet him : ain't got time to stay
Got the boxcar blues : feel like a tramp
Going to be down : in a Texas camp
Told the engineer : to drive them down
Broke and hungry : tired of tramping around
Boxcar boxcar : don't you carry two
Ride me ride me : sooth my boxcar blues

Western Union : send this telegram
To my man : way down in Birmingham
??? : please don't play today
So disgusted : got no place to stay
Send me car fare : want to come back home
When I get back : never will I roam
Am I hungry : I ain't nothing but
Stomach's empty : think my throat is stuck

The road to hardship : leads right to the poorhouse door
I'm going there : and ain't coming back no more
Poorhouse poorhouse : open wide your poorhouse gate
I'm down and out : now I know it's too late
Spent my money : spent it on my so-called friends
And now I'm broke : that's where their friendship ends
Here's the wagon : it's come to take me away
In the poorhouse : I'll be till Judgment Day

Anybody here want to try my cabbage : just step this way
Anybody here like to buy good cabbage : just holler hey
There's no sweeter cabbage : anywhere in town
You can have it boiled : until it's nice and brown
Gave some to the parson : and he shook with glee
He took up collection : gave it all to me
Gave it to a corn doctor : to fix my feet
Every time he sees me : he wants to eat
Gave some to the jailor : who turned the key on me
When I got through feeding him : he said gal you're free

Hear the thunder rumbling : see the lightning flash
Devil is a-groaning : listen to that crash
The trees are breaking : shaking all around
The wind is howling : hear that wicked sound
Gee I'm frightened : nearly scared to death
That's why I'm hiding : I'm all out of breath
My man's cruel : left me all alone
In the darkness : I just weep and moan
The storm is raging : I know what I'll do
I'll start in praying : till the storm is through

I got on : my walking shoes
I'm going to walk : away my blues
He stays out late : every night
Comes back home : and wants to fight
Whiskey : and trifling men
In the jail : would be my end

Talk about blues : you ought to hear mine
The man I love : keeps me worried all the time
One thing I hate : I can't have my way
The man that mistreat me : should be buried today
The better I treat him : the worse he treats me
I'm going to keep a good man : wherever he can be
You can always call : your good man's hand
Just let him know : that you got another man

Can't sell no whiskey : I can't sell no gin

Ain't got no money : to buy my winter coat
Can't save a dollar : to save my doggone soul
I can't keep open : I'm going to close the shack

The chief of police : done tore my playhouse down
No use in grieving : I'm going to leave this town

Now you may go : but you'll come back some day
And you'll be sorry : that you went away
When you think of my good loving : that's the time you'll find
That none of your flip-floppers : going to satisfy your mind
You miss my love and kisses : and you wish you back home
But someone else : will be picking on your chicken bones
I've got another daddy : and he's sweet as can be
And what I like about him : he just idolize me
You might back up in your stable : when the snow begins to fall
But you'll find another mule : just kicking in your stall

Everybody in this world : got something that they crave
And when they get just what they want : then you see them rave
Poor folks crave fine clothes and money : rich folks crave the gold
But what I crave is loving : that will satisfy my soul
And when he kisses me : Lordy knows
A funny feeling : goes from my head to my toes

I'm like a red-hot stove : I'm burning down
And the *moon is* ??? : in this man's town
I'm low and ornery : don't care what I do
Feel like cutting my man : half in two
A hornets' nest : don't mean a thing to me
I been stung so much : I'm up a tree
Now dynamite : ain't got a chance you see
I'm red-hot : and dangerous as can be

If somebody finds me : when I'm dead and gone
Say I did self-murder : I died with my boots on
Took a Smith and Wesson : and blew out my brain
Didn't take no poison : I couldn't stand the strain
No I ain't no coward : and I'll tell you why
I was tired of living : but wasn't scared to die
Take me to the graveyard : put me in the ground
Please write on my tombstone : my daddy threw me down
In my farewell letter : someone's sure to find
So goodbye old cold world : I'm glad you're left behind

Six pallbearers : take his to his last go-round
Going to place him : 'neath six feet of ground
Cemetery : sure is one old lonesome place
When you're dead : they throw dirt in your face
Yes I loved him : but he trifled with my heart
Had to shoot him : because he was too smart
Went gay-cutting : with another sealskin brown
Rambled : till the butcher cut him down

Going north child : where I can be free
Where there's no hardships : like in Tennessee
Going where : they don't have Jim Crow laws
Don't have to work there : like in Arkansas
When I cross : the Mason-Dixon Line
Goodbye old *gallion* : mama's going a-flying
Going to daddy : got no time to lose
*So I won't be alone* : can hear my northbound blues

Don't know what to do with myself : at night
Don't know anyone : that will treat me right
Listen I don't mean maybe : but you know
Take it from me : and don't you call my bluff
Need the kind of loving : that will make my heart beat
The sort that will thrill me : from my head to my feet

I'm a backbiting mama : looking for a cheating man
When you start double-crossing : you play right into my hand
If you stay out all night : and come home at four
You'll get back in time : to see me unlock my door
You can tell the world : I ain't no fool
I learned backbiting : when I went to school

I've got the Dallas blues : and the Main Street heart disease
Buzzing around my head : like a swarm of little honeybees
I'm going to put myself : on a Santa Fe and go
To that Texas town : where you never see the ice and snow
I wonder : if my sweet baby will wait for me
Maybe someone else :

If you see a blind man : on the street
Just remember : that he's got to eat
You can't live : in this big world alone
You might have : the finest kind of home
No one ever knows: what the future has in store
Never drive : a beggar from your door

I don't feel welcome : I'm going to blow
Your ways and actions : really ails me so
Crying and weeping : won't do me no good
I'm a lonesome mama : need someone to chop my wood
I'm going to keep on going : till I find a mate
Then I will quit wandering : before it's too late

If you start telling her : he's got the stuff
She will walk right in : and make your home life tough
If your good man can please you : don't tell a soul
Just keep him well supplied : with down-home jellyroll
If he's got a little something : not like the rest
Just keep him busy : he will never leave your nest
He beats you *then* and loves you : pay that no mind
Because what you got must suit him : that's the surest sign

The man I love : is oh so good to me
I'm just crazy : want the world to see
Buys me clothes : like I never had
*Now all* : it used to be *the mad*
I have to pinch myself : to see if I'm awake
Meals with him : all taste like wedding cake

I'm a real kind mama : looking for a loving man
I ain't got nobody : who will come and claim my hand
Now all I want : is all your love
At morning noon and night : that's all I'm thinking of

Now it's too late to holler baby : too late to weep and moan
Too late to holler great God : when that stack of dollars done gone
Well it's mama mama mama : what that you got in that grip
That's nothing but a stack of dollars : you babe going to take a little trip
I'm sitting on a stack of dollars : just as high as I am tall
If you be my little old baby : you sure can have them all
Well it's baby baby : I tell you what I will do
I will give you stack of dollars : just to make one more night with you
You can mistreat me baby : do anything you want to do
Some day you going to want me : but your baby won't want you
Now I'm going to sing this verse baby : and I ain't going to sing no more
For that stack of dollars is worrying me : Lord and I got to go

I went to the river : couldn't get across
I jumped on your papa : because I thought he was a horse
Up she jumped : down she fell
Her mouth flew open : like a mussel shell
You sister was a teddy : your daddy was a bear
Put the muzzle on your mama : because she had bad hair
If you want to hear : that elephant laugh
Take him down to the river : and wash his yas yas yas
If you want to go to heaven : when you D I E
You got to put on your collar : and your T I E
If you want to get the rabbits : out the L O G
You got to put on the stump : like a D O G
Run here doctor : run here fast
See what's the matter : with his yas yas yas

And that Big Four the Big Four : is a mean old train to ride
She took my babe away : and left me dissatisfied
Baby is all I want mama : just one more crack at you
If I can't make you love me : then I don't care what you do
Please hold my head baby : and let my whiskey run down
Lord I catch that Big Four : and beat it on back to town
When I asked that woman : Lord to let me be her kid
She say you might get buggish : Lord you won't keep it hid
I've got the blues for my baby : my babe got the blues for me
For she went and caught that Big Four : she beat it back to Tennessee
Just a few more days : and a few more nights ain't long
You going to reach for your boiler : and your plate will be gone

It's too late too late : too late too late too late
Here we are on our way to the holdover : and we cannot hesitate
Mmm : these boards is killing me
Say I know I am a criminal : but I always want to be free
Oh no : these raids is killing me
*See that woman* about it baby : Lord it's down in Tennessee
Mmm : these raids is killing me
I got the raiding squad blues : the holdover is killing poor me
When the raid began : the people began to squall
The sergeant said ain't no need a-squalling : the captain said to bring you all
When I had money : my friends all ganged around
Now I'm in this raid : my friends have all thrown me down

Baby I'm going uptown : tell the chief police
My woman quit me : I can't see no peace
She keep me worried : bothered all the time

Well I love you woman : love your husband too
I have to love your husband : to get to be with you
Because he don't allow : no man around his house

My mama told me : my papa too
Don't let no woman : be the death of you
She don't allow me : to stay out all night long

What you going to do : when they tear your barrelhouse down
Going to pack my suitcase : hunt some other town
Well they say everybody talking : about your honky-tonky blues

Well they say everybody talking : about your honky-tonky baby
You ought to see : that curly-headed monkey-head
Head is curly : baby and bushy too

You can always tell baby : when your woman going to treat you mean
If you ask for a glass of water : she give you a glass of gasoline
Some of these women : they sure to be ashamed
Babe they go out and take money : from a man walking with a walking cane
What makes you blow up baby : every time I speak to you
You make me think : that you full of gasoline too
I've got the trickiest woman : that you ever seen
Whenever she get mad : she blows up just like gasoline
Won't you let me tell you partner : what the gasoline women will do
They will stay out all night long : then come home and blow up on you
Hey baby : you just full of gas as you can be
Because when you get drunk : you come home and blow up on me
Some of these gasoline women : I just can't understand
They'll cook *make one* for their husband : they'll chicken for their man

I runned to the river : runned so fast
And you couldn't see nothing : but that yas yas yas
If you want to hear : that elephant grunt
You take him down to the river : and then wash his trunk
Up he jumped : down he fell
His trap flew open : like a mussel shell
If you keep it dirty : and I keep it clean
You don't know : what keeping it dirty means
I will tell you one thing : and I mean it
It sure will take soap and water : for to keep it clean
The terriblest sight : that I ever seen
Was a cook cooking victuals : and his hands wasn't clean
You got a head like a mouse : mouth like a goat
Every time you see me : you looking for some soap

Well it's everything I tell you : you run and tell your daddy-law

I ain't going to tell you nothing else : because you done run and tell your daddy-law

And it's everything I give you : you give it to your daddy-law

Hey my doggy jumped a rabbit : and he run him for a solid mile
When he seen he couldn't catch him : so he cried just like a natural child
Yeah your sister was a teddy : your daddy was a great big bear
Put a rope around my neck : you can lead me anywhere
When I asked that woman : to let me be her kid
She say you might get mawkish : baby you won't keep it hid

Here come my tight-haired woman : I can tell by the way she walks
But I know she be shaking that thing : because I can tell by the way she talks
I don't want no tight-haired woman : to cook no meat for me
Because she's so tight-haired and evil : I'm scared she might poison poor me

Tell me Roberta : what's the matter with you
This man ain't got nobody : to take his troubles to

I'm sitting down here wondering : would a matchbox hold my clothes

Looking for my girl : Lord that we all call Lucille
I know you don't want me : why don't you tell me so
Then you won't be bothered : with me around your house no more
Lord my good girl quit me : my kid done put me down
I wouldn't hurt so bad : but the doggone news across town
We got a new way of spelling : Memphis Tennessee
Double M double E : Lord A Y Lord Z
Ooh : my gal done quit me now
I'm going to the river : I'm going to jump overboard and drown

I wish I had : my poor heart in my hand
I'd show you women : how to treat a man
I'm going I'm going : your crying won't make me stay
For the more you cry : further you drive me away
You know you didn't want me : you oughtn't've made no stall
There's plenty more women :
If the river was whiskey : I'd stay drunk all the time
So a woman like you : could not worry my mind
Some of these mornings : baby listen to what I say
I'm going away to leave you : it will be too late to pray

Ooh : what am I going to do now
Because the girl I love : she don't treat me right
Baby : what do you want [me, your papa] to do
Beg borrow and steal : bring it all home to you
Say the sun's going to shine : in my back door some day
Lord the wind's going to blow : blow my blues away
Hey : wonder where the I C train
Babe I'll go to my woman : you go to your man
Ooh : I'd rather be dead and in my grave
Than be here in the world : baby and be your slave

Don't you wish : your good girl was long and tall like mine
Lord she ain't good-looking : but I think she takes her time
Said my good girl said : she didn't want me no more
But she don't mind *dancing* : Lord everywhere I go
Lord the train I ride : is sixteen coaches long
And she don't *allow* nothing : but chocolate to the bone
I'm worried now : been worried all day long
Babe I'm going to be worried : until the day I'm gone
Lord there's some say yellow : but give me my black and brown
When your high brown quit you : your black will run you down
I want to see want to see : the girl I'm *for painted about*
I be so glad : I sure can't help but shout

I'm going away baby : take me seven long months to ride
January February : March April May June July
I was three years old : when my poor mother died
If you mistreat me : mistreat a motherless child
I dreamt last night : the whole round world was mine
Wasn't nothing at all : but my good girl jumping down
She put carbolic in my coffee : turpentine in my tea
Strychnine in my biscuits : Lord but she didn't hurt me
Baby when I marry : going to marry an Indian squaw
Big chief Lord : be my daddy-in-law

I got the blues so bad : it hurts my feet to walk
I wouldn't hurt so bad : but it hurt my tongue to talk
Mama I feel like jumping : through the keyhole in your door
I can jump so easy : your man will never know
Some people say : worried blues ain't tough
If they don't kill you : hell you mighty rough
Hitch up my buggy : please saddle up my black mare
I'm going to find my woman : on the road somewhere
She caught the rumbling : I caught the falling down
If I ever see her : I never turn around
